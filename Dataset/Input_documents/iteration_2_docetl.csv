The brain fascinates me beyond any other area of science because as we study it, we inherently discover more about ourselves and the process of learning itself. As the field of computational neuroscience accelerates, I want to become an authority on neuroscience research so I can interface with an expanding network of similar minds who desire to understand how the brain works – in doing so, I want to transform my own mind and lift my own limitations when it comes to learning. From my time at Columbia, engaging with the Zuckerman Institute, and taking coursework under Professor Lazar, as well as my time working as an Air Force Research Lab Scholar, I am convinced that a career in this field will be intellectually exciting and transformative in how I think about the world. My goal in completing a Ph.D. is to develop a rigorous way of thinking and obtain the professional credentials that will enable me to understand, internalize, and build upon neuroscience literature and any other field of inquiry. At the beginning of my undergraduate studies, I set my eyes on the field of neuroscience but found that the neurobiology track was outdated – so I made my own. I entered the field of computational neuroscience through the study of computational science. As an undergraduate, I wedged my foot in the door of an HPC laboratory working on parallelizing jobs for computing clusters and then in the door of a quantum computing laboratory, where I wrote my first preprint on using quantum random walks to solve a class of sparse linear systems of equations. With my experience, I applied for a position at AFRL working in my current laboratory – my initial project in the summer of 2021 was using CNNs to track the motion of flying insects in high-quality video recordings. As I became more interested in the field and in making research my career, I began looking into graduate programs and discovered the remote Fly Circuits Journal Club at Columbia. I entered the master’s program, and in the summer of 2022, I returned to AFRL to work on programming a neural network on a custom neuromorphic multi-color optoelectronic synapse sensor, resulting in my first cross-institutional collaboration and peer-reviewed publication. As I entered the master’s program last fall, I undertook coursework with Aurel Lazar and enrolled in the theoretical neuroscience course at the Zuckerman Institute. Simultaneously, my boss invited me to Benjamin Wu propose my own project for my work with AFRL. I began to learn the visualization and execution tools of the Bionet Lab and interface with researchers at ZI to draft a project involving the computational modeling of the Drosophila visuomotor decision-making process for long versus short escape takeoff responses. After the project was approved, I began planning for the summer 2023 term. Throughout the spring, as I conducted the literature review, I took ECBM6070 under Professor Lazar, where I learned about the beautiful and intelligent alignment of the fruit fly retinal columns. Here, I knew that neuroscience was the right field for me. However, a hurdle presented itself in my project planning in that the simulation tools of the Bionet lab were limited and highly convoluted even for the medulla 7 columns simulation, let alone the downstream neurons. At the right time, as part of my advanced theory course at the Zuckerman Institute, I discovered work by Srini Turaga at Janelia that introduced the Deep Mechanistic Network, which is just what I needed. With the pieces in place, this summer, I led a small team of AFRL Scholars to carry out my project plan, leading to a successful department presentation, poster presentation, and technical engineering memorandum. This fall, I have continued fleshing out the project independently and have extended the model to account for multi-colored visual input. Throughout this process, I have solidified my desire to work in the research industry, and my purpose for pursuing the Ph.D. has further clarified: to gain the license necessary to autonomously manage my projects in the future instead of just working under others’ shifting timelines and funding. In the long term, I aim to become a leader in neuroscience research at the intersection of academia, industry, and defense. Within the engineering department at Columbia, I am excited by the prospect of applying what I have learned working with the Deep Mechanistic Network model to expand the simulation capabilities of the Bionet Lab tool infrastructure to recently added datasets such as the ventral nerve cord and optic lobe. At Columbia, more broadly, I am excited by the prospect of collaborating with researchers in the Zuckerman Institute whom I have previously conversed with during my coursework – particularly those doing connectomic research with the fruit fly. From my discussion with leaders in the field, there is a need for high-quality recording data processing pipelines for pose-tracking, and the engineering department at Columbia is well-positioned to fulfill this need. I am excited to be a liaison between professors within these two departments and employ my computational research experience to further the field of neuroscience. Benjamin Wu There have already been many times when I have had doors closed in my face. As I finished my final year of undergraduate and applied for the master’s at Columbia, I attended the Fly Circuits Journal Club at Columbia hosted by now assistant professor Gabrielle Gutierrez – but when I entered the program, the journal club shut down. As I worked with the AFRL on optoelectronic synapses and gained the opportunity to draft my own project description, I took it one step further and fleshed it out for an NDSEG fellowship application. However, after passing the initial rounds of subject-matter expert reviews, it was rejected in April by the DoD panelists. This fall, hoping to get a head-start on Ph.D. preparations, I asked about the possibility of a funded position but found out that AFOSR funding had fallen through. After completing my fall research commitment with the AFRL and applying for next spring and summer to finish this project, I have one last chance to knock on the door to fulfill this Ph.D. dream – but I am also not putting all my hope in it, as I apply for full-time defense research positions. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application.

"937487022","{""SOP"":""Abhudaya Shrivastava From an early age, a profound passion for Computers and Technology began to take root within me. At the tender age of four, I was first introduced to Microsoft Paint through school, and my innate curiosity drove me to explore my initial encounter with a video game, \""Conflict: Desert Storm.\"" As I progressed in my academic journey, I acquired valuable knowledge about various computer applications. During my penultimate and final years of schooling, I encountered a significant coding assignment that entailed utilizing NetBeans IDE, the C Programming language, and MYSQL. Drawing upon my creativity and understanding of management and organizational structures, I proposed the topic of an airline booking management system application for my group. This application encompassed numerous features, ranging from facilitating flight bookings on any given day to calculating miles and displaying paths on a globe. Engaging in this project provided me with a fresh perspective on the realm of computer science, enabling me to transcend mere enthusiasm and aspire toward true innovation. Prior to this experience, while my zeal for innovation and research was evident, I lacked the practical knowledge of how to pursue it effectively. However, the two years of my high school education served as a transformative period, opening doors for me to explore and delve into ideas that yield innovative solutions applicable to real-life scenarios. This newfound curiosity urged me to venture beyond the realm of Computers and delve into the scientific principles that underpin them, thereby empowering me to test novel ideas for practical applications. Consequently, at the age of fifteen, I took the decisive step of enrolling at Rutgers University Camden to pursue a ‘degree in Computer Science and Finance. This educational pursuit not only fueled my passion for technology but also paved the way for my future endeavors in the realms of innovation and research. My aspiration is to develop pragmatic solutions to real-world complex systems, thereby making a meaningful contribution to society. During my time at Rutgers University, I was awarded a merit-based scholarship due to an impressive CGPA in high school and SAT score. Throughout my studies, I encountered various challenging yet significant concepts across diverse courses. Additionally, I developed optimized solutions for stack and queue operations. Building on my skills and prior knowledge in Computer Science, I secured internships in Research and Development roles as a Data Scientist and Analyst, which is my career goal. These experiences allowed me to acquire technical and soft skills including but not limited to Advanced Python Programming, Tensor Flow, Geocoding, UI/UX Design, Tableau, ETL pipeline deployment, Apache Airflow, MYSQL Workbench, Microsoft SQL Server, Leadership, Teamwork, Optimization. While facing novel Abhudaya Shrivastava challenges. Daily, I worked with extensive datasets and prepared them for analysis and deploying AI engines. I am particularly proud of two internship projects. Firstly, I enhanced a navigation system by creating a data mining algorithm to transform data into a readable format, incorporating geocoding for precise location information. Secondly, I collaborated with the Road Transport Authority of Dubai to automate the Transit Line Monitoring System. I deployed a neural network-based machine learning model for a complex system to detect transit disruptions, and overcoming data formatting challenges through research and perseverance. While I worked my way up with professional experience, I remained steadfast in my goal to innovate using Computer Science concepts for the betterment of society and the future. This led me to delve into research, with a particular fascination for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Determined to contribute, I wrote my first paper, \""Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning in Space Network,\"" published by IEEE at a conference in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. The paper explores Transfer and Data Relay Systems (TDRS), which transmit space data from rovers and telescopic satellites. I employed neural network models: Data Belief Network for probabilistic reasoning in decision-making for rovers and satellites, and Restricted Boltzmann Machine for feature learning and generative modeling based on data from satellites and rovers. The RBM also supports the DBN in decision-making with feature learning and planetary object analysis. My interest in research deepened, leading to my recent IEEE paper, \""Security Analysis for Threats to Patient Data in the Medical Internet of Things\"". It addresses the security of Medical IoT, used for multiple applications to record and transmit data all over the hospital network. To counter security threats, I proposed implementing Transport Layer Security, Virtual Private Networks, and Cryptography for data transmission. Additionally, I suggested using neural networks for daily encryption updates and traffic analysis. Through contributions in the field of research and innovation, I aim to advance in AI and its applications by contributing as Data Scientist and/or Machine Learning technology evangelist. Based on my prior experiences, I am aware of the path I wish to pursue. Seeking mentorship and guidance, I am determined to embark on a Ph.D. journey in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and its Applications. During my junior year of Undergrad, I explored some of very prestigious universities which offers unique research opportunities. I found the Columbia University courses and research opportunities Abhudaya Shrivastava in Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, and Security & Privacy to capture my interest, especially the ongoing projects in different labs and multiple publications across labs via faculties. Their brief description of projects and admiration towards many publications in the above three fields resonated with my desired knowledge and skill development. Confident in my decision, I believe Columbia University offers the best academic environment for my aspirations. With mentorship and the comprehensive course offerings, I am optimistic about making significant contributions to the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Security & Privacy pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science."",""Resume"":""Shrivastava, Abhudaya; DOB: 11/06/2002; ID: 937487022 917-774-1358 | abhudaya.shrivastava@outlook.com | linkedin.com/in/abhudaya-shrivastava-a085711b2 | github.com/debugged-abh TECHNICAL SKILLS Languages: Python, MySQL, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS.

"493075143","{""SOP"":""Personal Statement Ever since I embarked on my academic journey, my passion for research and innovation within the realm of construction materials has continued to flourish. As I start a new chapter in my academic journey, I want to express my strong interest in the Ph.D. program in Civil Engineering at Columbia University and share the reasons that fuel my enthusiasm for this opportunity. My journey in research of civil engineering began with an exploration of novel construction materials, a subject that has captivated my curiosity. During my previous academic experience, I focused on understanding the complexities of low-carbon cement. This experience gave me a profound appreciation for the significance of lowering carbon emissions in the construction industry, a sector that is crucial to modern society. My involvement in this research allowed me to delve into the intricate world of construction materials and their environmental impact, thereby laying the foundation for my academic and research interests. As a current Master's student in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University, I possess a strong academic foundation in chemical engineering. This educational background equips me with the interdisciplinary knowledge necessary to approach the study of innovative construction materials from a comprehensive standpoint. An illustrative example of this interdisciplinary approach lies in the quest to enhance the carbonation degree of cement for increased CO 2 absorption. This challenge revolves around transport phenomena and reaction kinetics, domains rooted in chemical engineering principles. The seamless integration of these principles into construction materials research presents a unique opportunity to address pressing environmental issues and optimize material performance. This convergence of disciplines has ignited my passion for this field and reaffirmed my commitment to advancing it further. While pursuing my Master’s degree at Columbia University, I engaged in two significant research projects aimed at addressing environmental challenges. In my first project, which began in June 2023 and is ongoing, I delved into the area of carbon-neutral cement development. This research extended beyond traditional Portland cement, as I explored alternative cement systems, including magnesium oxide cement and fly ash-substituted ordinary Portland cement, with a primary focus on carbonation curing. My investigations encompassed an intricate analysis of various parameters, such as mix design, and their influence on the physical properties and carbonation degree of the cement. To gain a comprehensive understanding, I learned and employed a range of mechanical testing machines to measure the physical properties of cement samples. I also learned and employed thermogravimetric analysis to quantify their mineral compositions. One of the most exciting outcomes of this project was the development of a mix design optimized for high CO uptake, which holds great potential for reducing the carbon 2 footprint in construction materials. Simultaneously, I engaged in another research since May 2022, concentrating on the chemical stabilization of heavy metals within Waste-to-Energy (WTE) fly ash. The primary focus of this project was to find sustainable disposal solutions for WTE fly ash, aiming to make it safe for landfills or suitable for reuse in civil engineering applications. My work involved the exploration of the intricate reaction mechanisms associated with both inorganic stabilization and organic chelation to reduce the leaching of heavy metals. Through rigorous experiments, I uncovered the effectiveness of various chemical agents in reducing heavy metal leachability, leading to the identification of optimal agents.

My academic goals are properly metbythe competent program design and great faculty team there. I have solid grounds for believing that this Ph.D. program will help me grow professionally so that I can achieve my career goals of becoming an engineer, a senior researcher inatechnologycompany,oranacademia professor in the future, which is exactlyinlinewiththeprogram’sdesigngoalandconvinces methatImadetherightchoice. Since 2021, I have been enrolled inthemaster’sprogramofDataScienceatTuftsUniversity with an educational background in Statistics from GuangdongUniversityofForeignStudies. Therefore, it iseasytoseefrommypastacademicperformancethatIhaveestablishedasolid foundation of knowledge in the two areas mentionedabove,particularlyinregardtosubjects like Mathematical Statistics, Probability Theory, Advanced Mathematics, Applied Statistics, Algorithms, Statistics Pattern Recognition, Data Mining, Deep learning, Machine Learning andsoforth. In my past study, I have placed a special emphasis on the courses of Machine Learning Principles and its framework programming like Python & Java programming, in addition to my proficiency in Pytorch, and Scikit-learn machine learning framework. My PhD stage’s primary focuswillalsobeonmachinelearning.IintendtolearnmoreaboutFederallearning, Deep graph learning, Natural language processing, Generative model diffusion, Application of graph data, and Graph machine learning, and learn somemathematicscoursesinMachine Learning, such as Stochastic process, Information theory,Bayesianmachinelearning,etc.,to improve my mathematical derivation and my capacity to turn objective problems into mathematical problems. Besides, I want to conduct more projectprogramming,completethe project from scratch, increase my proficiency at translating mathematical issues into computer language, work on generative models/algorithms, and improve theinadequaciesof currentgraphgenerativemodels. What affected me mostwasthecourseStatisticPatternRecognitiontaughtbyDr.IsaacLage. Thisclasstaughtmemanyprobabilisticmodels,suchastheHiddenMarkovModel,Gaussian mixture model, and k-means algorithm. Also, I learned how to perform inference through MCMC and variational inference. I think theclasspavedasolidfoundationformystatistical learningbackground,whichhelpedmealotinmyfuturemachinelearningresearch. In the deep learning course taught by Prof. Liping Liu, I found myself veryintotheclasson generative modeling. In this class, I comprehensively learned about various neural networks such as RNN, transformer, and CNN. What excited me the most was the course project I worked on, in which I did style transformation by using cycleGAN. In thisproject,Itriedto innovate the loss function and discriminator architecture. Specifically, I reweighted adversarial loss, cycle consistent loss, and identity loss to see how the image style would change accordingly. Besides, I simplified the discriminator to make the optimization of the generator easier. Though my ideas did not improve over the original model, I became more interestedingenerativemodelsanddeeplearning. To better have hands-on experience, I have worked on two projects related to graph generation, one was to benchmark the generative performance over one-shot and sequential graph generative models, and the second was to develop graph generative models that meet differentialprivacy. The goal of the first project was to provide a fair comparison of two kinds of generative models in terms of the likelihood metrics. Since one-shot generative models are usually permutation-invariant and sequential generative model depends on the generating orders, these two models are not directly comparable due to the marginalization over the permutation. In this project, my first duty was to derive the log-likelihood for the one-shot generative models, by taking the permutation into consideration. This leads me to get familiar with the mechanism of flow-based generative models and how to model discrete data. While thelog-likelihoodcalculationiswell-establishedinsequentialgenerativemodels, my second duty is to run extensive experiments tocomparethesetwokindsofmethods,thus bridging the two models over this more universal metric. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Liu Li-ping on this project. I learned a lot about the basic techniques of Variational Inference, data dequantization, and a broad class of Graph Neural Networks. Furthermore, I learn how to code with graph data structure, which is more complicated than imageandtext dataasitsirregulardatarepresentation. The second project was accepted by ICML2023. Its main goal is to generate graphs that preserve the graph statistics without leaking the users’ privacy in the training graphs. However, current deep graph generative models cannot generate large networks with satisfying graph statistics. The first goal of this project is to developascalableandpowerful graph generative model, which leads us to first turn our attention to the diffusion model. During the development of the new diffusion graph model, I am responsible for implementing a batching training procedure, which speeds up the training and reduces the gradient variance. Besides, I derived the posterior of the non-uniform diffusion forward kernel. When working on the derivation, I had a deep understanding of how the diffusion models are derived, which [made me gain more understanding generative model. Besides, I read plenty of papers on differential privacy with graph data and papers about how to use differential privacyandcreatedata.Afterdevelopingsuchamodel,Iwillfocusongenerating largenetworkswithprivacyguarantees. Objectively speaking, I choose machine learning as the major topic of my Ph.D. research primarily due to my advantages in statistics, mathematics, and computer knowledge and skills. Considering statistics, as an illustration, Machine Learning uses techniques like Markov Monte Carlo Sampling, Bayesian inference, conditional probability in diffusion models, and ELBO derivation in variational auto-encoders, etc., which makes statistics applications extremely valuable and further piques my interest. Recently, machine learning has developed a number of extremely potent capabilities, such asthechatGPT3thatwasjust released, which has made me realize the enormous potential and development space in this field of study, and greatly inspired me to invest in further research and exploration of machinelearning. Becoming anexpertinthedomainsofgraphmachinelearninggenerativemodels,andnatural languageismyprofessionallife’sambition. In a sense, myresearchsupervisorandFeynmanarethetwopeoplewhohavehadthebiggest influences on my intense interest and motivation in scientific research. My mentor is a serious thinker, whose dedication to research and analytical approach has had a significant impact on me. He always challenges me to speak with mathematics, articulate ideas with mathematics, and approach issues with rigorous and abstract mathematical thinking during our academic sessions. My knowledge of the issue gradually deepened afterdiscoveringthis sophisticated mathematical statement, and I started to pay closer attention to my mathematical prowess. TheotherpersonisFeynman,whohadagreaterspiritualinfluenceon me, and whose quote I use as my motto. In aninterview,thehostquestionedFeynmanabout the significance of astronomical research. He responded that in truth, it may not have much significance or significantly improve people’s lives, but learning itself is the best purpose since it allows us to better understand the world and explore the unknown. Yes, seeking knowledge is the greatest purpose and joy, thus I believe conducting research calls for this kindofmindset."",""Resume"":""Jiaxing He (781)539-3142 Meford,Massachusetts jiaxing0218@gmail.com linkedin.com/in/jiaxing-he-43b91523b/ EDUCATION MasterofDataScience GPA:3.73/4.0 Sep.2021-now TuftsUniversity BachelorofEconomicStatistic GPA:3.43/4.0 Sep.2016-Jun.2020 GuangdongUniversityofForeignStudy SKILLS ToolsandLanguages Python(Numpy,Pandas,Scipy),Spark,Pytorch,Java,Shell,Sk-learn,Git,LaTeX, QuantitativeResearch MachineLearning(cv2/pytorch-geometric/graphneuralnetwork/naturallanguageprocessing/computer vision/traditionalmachinelearning),MySQL,GoogleCloudPlatform,SPSS FinancialAnalysisskill CFAlevelIpassed,(straightApass) PUBLICATION 1.Chen,X.,He,J.,Han,X.,Liu,L.EfficientandDegree-GuidedGraphGenerationviaDiscreteDiffusionModeling,International ConferenceonMachineLearning(ICML)2023 EXPERIENCE StudentResearchAssistant(Pytorch,VariationalAutoEncoder,LatentVariableDistribution).

However, despiteAlphaFoldundoubtedlybeingamilestoneachievement,thestructuresitpredictsstilllackcriticalbi- ologicalcontext: Insteadofexistinginisolation,proteinsofteninteractwithsmallchemicalcompoundsthat areessentialtotheirfunction. Smallchemicalcompoundsarealsothemostcommonlyemployedclassof drug used to modulate protein function. More advanced models for predicting protein-ligand interactions are therefore needed to fully leverage the power of current machine learning methods for drug discovery against novel targets. In addition, the recent success in protein structure prediction has been followed by significant advancements in generative modelling of entirely new protein structures. Models incorpo- rating cutting-edge research from geometric deep learning and natural language processing have already shown promising success for designing proteins with desired features, yet there is still a lot of potential for pushing the frontier. Combining a background in Biochemistry with more than 2.5 years of computational research experience, I believe I am ideally suited to tackle such research questions. As a PhD student in the Columbia Computer Science program, I therefore plan to focus on developing novel machine learning methodsforpredictingmolecularinteractionsanddesigningnewproteinswithtailoredproperties. MyundergraduatestudieshavegivenmeafundamentalunderstandingoftheproblemsIamnowtry- ing to solve with machine learning. After graduating high school as best student in my year with an award fromtheGermanChemicalSociety,IjoinedtheprestigiousBiochemistryprogramatHeidelbergUniversity as one of only 25 selected students, where I learned about the inner workings of proteins and molecular causesofdiseases. InmyfirstresearchprojectinProfessorMaikeBublitz’sgroupattheUniversityofOx- ford, I used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a membrane protein in complex with novel inhibitors. Now,Iamusingsuchexperimentalproteinstructuresastrainingdataformachinelearningmod- els,andmypreviousexperiencewithcrystallographyhasprovenatremendousadvantageforconstructing bespokehigh-qualitydatasets. Working on molecular docking simulations with Professor Rebecca Wade for my bachelor’s thesis at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS), I experienced firsthand how computational algo- rithms can efficiently generate plausible mechanistic hypotheses. Since then, I have used my master’s studiestospecializeincomputationalbiologywithcourseworksuchasBioinformatics/MolecularDynamics, andFoundationsofmachinelearningandhigh-dimensionaldataanalysis. Aimingtogetanunderstanding of diverse problems in the field, I chose to work on a breadth of research projects, ranging from physics- based protein design in Professor Bruno Correia’s group at E´cole Polytechnique Fe´de´rale de Lausanne 1 PersonalStatement LukasJarosch (EPFL) to analyzing high-dimensional transcriptomics data in Dr. Judith Zaugg’s group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). Exploring different research fields has taught me how to quickly assimilate new knowledge through self-study, for example by getting up to speed with the programming languageRinjustafewweekswhenstartingatEMBL.Myresearchhasbeenproductive,withpartsofmy bachelor’sthesisintegratedintoajournalsubmissiontoCirculation,andtwoothermanuscriptscurrentlyin writing. I have long been interested in machine learning methods and their ability to easily grasp complex patterns in high-dimensional data. This motivated me to join Roche for a 6-month project on probabilistic modeling of antibody sequences from display datasets. Display campaigns involve the vast screening of antibodylibrariesagainsttargetepitopesovermultipleroundsinordertoenrichstronglybindingsequences. Givenalarge-scaledatasetofmillionsofantibodyvariantsfromsuchacampaign,Iworkedondeveloping modelsforpredictingtheaffinityofexperimentallyunobservedsequencesusingGaussianprocesses(GPs). Studyingtheliteraturesurroundingstochasticprocessesprovedchallengingatfirst, thoughIquicklycame toappreciatetherigorousuncertaintyestimatesprovidedbyBayesianmodels. Comparedtothepreviously usedrandomforests,myGPmodelsimprovedpredictiveperformanceandwereabletomuchbetterquantify their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution sequences. In order to streamline the future application of those models, I wrote the “BayDisplay” Python library for working with Gaussian processes on display datasets, which is now internally used at Roche. Additionally, I presented my findings as a poster at the ProteinEngineeringSummitBoston(PEGSBoston2023). My master’s thesis in the AlQuraishi laboratory at Columbia has allowed me to fully merge my back- ground in computational biochemistry with my interest in cutting-edge machine learning methods. The maingoalofmythesisistoexpandAlphaFoldintoamodelthatisfullycapableofprotein-ligandco-folding, bridgingthepreviouslymentionedgapbetweenproteinstructurepredictionanddrugdiscovery. Leveraging my past experience in working with protein structures and large-scale sequence datasets, I first created a novel high-quality dataset of protein-ligand complexes and also computed new multiple sequence align- ments, required as inputs to AlphaFold, which have become part of a publication accepted at NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks. By adding ligand representations and customized loss functions to the network,Isuccessfullyimplementedthefirstversionoftheco-foldingmodel“OpenBind”. Firstexperiments withOpenBindhaveshownpromisingresultsonsmallertestsets,andthemodeliscurrentlybeingtrained atlargescaleonthefulltrainingdata. InmyPhDIamhopingtocontinueworkingwithProfessorAlQuraishi towardspushingthefrontierofmachinelearningformolecularmodeling. Delving deep into AlphaFold’s source code made me appreciate how inter-disciplinary approaches 2 PersonalStatement LukasJarosch are key for tackling grand challenges such as the protein structure prediction problem. AlphaFold’s archi- tecture borrows from multiple different fields, combining graph transformers, SE(3)-equivariant attention, and masked language modeling, and recent protein design models have taken a similarly integrated ap- proach. Ithereforelookforwardtofurtherstrengtheningmyunderstandingofspecializedresearchareasin machine learning and am excited about potential learning and collaboration opportunities with Columbia’s stronganddiverseComputerSciencefaculty.

In addition,therecentsuccessofproteinlanguagemodelspiquedmyinterestinnaturallanguageprocessing, andIhavebeenparticularlyimpressedbytheresearchofProfessorMcKeownandProfessorCollins. In conclusion, my previous academic experience has uniquely prepared me for pursuing graduate researchindevelopingmodelsformolecularmodelingandproteindesign.

"534470689","{""SOP"":""Bibhusa Rawal Department of Computer Science A desire to extend my knowledge and a curiosity to learn the significance of the inevitable arrival of quantum era is what motivated me to study Ph.D. in Computer Science with a focus in quantum cryptography. More than 20years ago it was proven that quantum cryptography is unconditionally secure and quantum algorithms can solve classical problems for which we don’t have efficient classical algorithms. In the present date, we are in the NISQ (Noisy intermediate scale quantum devices) era where quantum processors contain up to 1000 qubits which aren’t enough to make a quantum leap for being fault-tolerant or reached the stage of quantum supremacy. With the imminent arrival of quantum computing era, we must now begin to prepare our information security systems to be able to resist quantum computers. If quantum computers are built, they would pose a challenge to the Church-Turing Thesis. The Church–Turing Thesis says that a computing problem can be solved on any computer that we could hope to build, if and only if it is computable by Turing machine. My research focus is post-quantum cryptography where I dream to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers with the goal of keeping existing public key infrastructure intact in a near future quantum era. Mathematics is so powerful with the perfect balance of patterns and structures in numbers. My enjoyment of the beauty of Mathematics is part of what motivates me toward innovation. It is also a guide when I am working on a problem: if I think of a few strategies, I will choose the one that seems most elegant first. I was initially in Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D. program at University of Maryland, College Park. However, during COVID-19, I had to drop out of school because of personal reasons. During my time in UMD, I took different classes ranging from Random Process, Information Theory, Estimation and Detection Theory, Systems Theory, Electromagnetic Theory, Compilers, Security, Machine Learning, Algorithms, Numerical Theory just in search of a course I find myself invested in and would like to spend the rest of my life working on. In my second year, I took Quantum Information Processing class and that is when I became really interested in theoretical areas of Quantum Information Science. Thereon, I’ve been interested in projects at the intersection of quantum computation, cryptography and Machine Learning. I earned my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Kathmandu Engineering College, Tribhuvan University. I was ranked first in B.E. in Electronics and Communication program of Tribhuvan University. I was highest scorer as a female student among all engineering students across all universities in Nepal. I was a merit-based scholarship holder for all semesters in B.E. program of my college. Bibhusa Rawal I was ranked first among all girl students in the Bachelor of Engineering Program – across all Engineering faculties - in Nepal and was conferred the “Nepal Chhatra Bidhya Padak (gold medal)” by the President of Nepal, Mrs. Bidya Devi Bhandari on 37th National Education Day and International Literacy Day-2016. During my second year in the undergraduate program, I became member of Robotics club of the college with a focus to build a community of open-source users and developers. As a member of this organization, I had the opportunity to assist my friends and mentor my juniors in their respective academic projects. Throughout my undergraduate program, I organized and conducted various workshops, exhibitions, robotics competitions, quizzes, and seminars. In the past, I’ve been an active member of Women in STEM Nepal which is a non-profit organization established to decrease the gender gap prevailing in STEM fields in Nepal. As its member, I’ve volunteered my free time to run classes under the project named “Children go coding” to expose and engage children of the age group 8-15 years to STEM education that includes logic development, building programming concepts, building design thinking concepts, and building hardware concepts via Arduino. Currently, I hold tuition classes on Math, Physics and Chemistry to high school students on weekdays. I teach kids on weekends under the STEM program. Columbia University is my choice for continuing my graduate education because I feel that the University can take a revolutionary step in the future of quantum computers, and I would be honored if I could be a part of it. I am aware of the commitment and resilience necessary for research work, but I also believe that my motivation and aptitude is strongest in this field. I aspire to build a career in teaching and research. I am positive that Columbia University will help establish a firm educational foundation needed to pursue this goal. My end target is to become a university professor and a competent researcher. I am sure that the stimulating educational ambiance and wisdom from distinguished teachers at Columbia University will help me grow immensely as a person as well as a proficient researcher in my field."",""Resume"":""Bibhusa Rawal 128 Sangam Basti Email: bibhusa.r@gmail.com Dhobighat Phone: 9851107113 Lalitpur 44600 Education: 2011-2015 Kathmandu Engineering College, Tribhuvan University, Nepal Bachelor in Electronics and Communication Engineering 2009-2011 St. Xavier’s College, Maitighar, Nepal Intermediate in Science Academic Positions: • Research Assistant, University of Maryland College Park, August 2018-December 2019 • Teaching assistant, University of Maryland College Park, August 2017- May 2018.

"993618511","{""SOP"":""PersonalStatement I have always been the biggest fan of sci-fi. It often gave me an optimistic outlook on the relationship betweentechnologyandsociety.Ever sinceIstarted mycomputer sciencejourneyat the University of Toronto, it seemed to me that the line between fantasy and reality had been getting blurrier day by day enabled by constant breakthroughs of artificial intelligence near me. Inspired by endless opportunities, I took the initiative and grasped ontomyfascination withthis ever-growing fieldfor myprofessional development. During my undergraduate studies, I wasfirst introducedtothe worldof AIina visualcomputing course notorious among students for its challenging mathematical concepts not suited for the faint-hearted. Throughout the course, I studied and implemented numerous algorithms for real-world computer vision applications that I never thought to be possible before, and this led me to explore advanced concepts such as machine learning. I utilized the opportunity to take every AI-related course the CS department had to offer and excel in them. Most of these upper-level courses were cross-listed with thegraduate departmentandgaveme aglimpseof the life of a graduate student long before graduate school. In my senior year,I workedas aresearch student under the supervision of Dr. Anna Goldenberg at Toronto’s Hospital for Sick Children. Initially funded by a grant from the Canadian government, I then continued my position as a research employee after graduation. During my two years at the hospital, I was involved in integrating a machine learning model in the ICU to monitor patient status and predict deterioration, such as cardiac arrest events, in order to alert staff to apply preemptive measures, which canbecritical inmoments oflife anddeath. Ibuilt data streamingpipelinesthat dealtwith both live data and historical data, contributed to the usability design in the ICU, and eventually Huang, Xi delivered the tool to its clinical trial. Furthermore, I employed NLP techniques using Transformer models to de-identify patient information in medical records to provide data for future research. I was fortunate enough to have gained much project experience, witnessing the incredible synergy of combining AI with healthcare. This rather new effort not only minimized the stress on paramedics but also enabled the automatic detection and analysis of patient conditions. While the work demanded the repetition of various experiments and occasionally posed challenges, the sense of fulfillment and pride was truly gratifying, as I saw impactful change inthemedicalindustry. While I worked on my master’s degree in software engineering atCarnegieMellonUniversity,I continued to take ML courses and got involved with more ML research throughout my entire degree. I waspartof an object recognition projectat CMUincollaboration withWalmartwhere I processed image data and trained Visual Transformer models.I amcurrentlyinvolved inanother computer vision research project under Dr. Asim Smailagic exploringaninnovative approachin medical image analysis combining neural network with wavelet transformation that removes unnecessary detailsin theimagepreservingprivacy andreducingcomputation withoutimpacting performance, and we are in progress to publishing our work. Aside from ML work in this project, I was able to revisit the mathematical side of computer vision, which took me back to when I first discovered the wonders of AI algorithms. I utterlyenjoyed myresearchexperiences working with differentaspects ofAI,as theyhave shownmehow much goodAIcanbring toour current societyin aworld of dataand Iam dedicatedtocontinuingmy journeyfurtheringmyself. In addition to research, I have had two years of industry experience working at State Streetas a cloud software engineer. I eagerly seized the opportunity to master a range of software development tools and refine my software-building skills. This experience has prepared me for Huang, Xi my master's studies in software engineering and helped me gain avaluableunderstanding ofthe tech industry. This experience has also equipped me withthebeneficial insightsofcollaborating within a team, both in person and remotely. My industry experience, coupled with pragmatic software engineering training that I have done during my master’s degree, has shown me practical aspectsthatareasbeneficialas theoreticalknowledge inresearchwork. Perhaps with a different concept of self-worth, I am more captivated with chiseling into the unknown, a diversion from the common goal of my peers in my industry-oriented program of “making big money” straight out of graduationas asoftware engineer.Withmygrowing interest in using ML to improve life, I deem that the elevation of myself in research is imperative. Iam anxious to work with professors with overlapped interests in ML at Columbia. I have a deep yearning to boost my individual research ability as well as thecapacity toresolvetech problems innovatively. The academic prowess here has been world-renowned and the ML research has been diverse in various areas among whichIwouldlike tolearn morein.Ilook forwardtobeing an active member in the CS program, and to studying and working in a vigorous community. After my PhD studies, I look forward to working as a scientist, extending mystudies intheML field, and contributing to the development of AI in the realworld. Iwant todivedeeply into my own expertise,especiallyinhealthcareand theapplication ofnewAI technologies,and Iam very optimistic about my career paths after completing a PhD as a scientist. I’m confident that Iwill be content ina fieldof prosperousinnovationbridging reality andsci-fi.I know thatit willbe far from a smooth ride, but I await to broaden my skill set and knowledge with pleasure, knowing what I will be trying to do is unique, inspiring more intelligent development in the areas that benefitmankind’s future.

"134745944","{""SOP"":""Yifan Qin Originating from my hometown, Shanxi, a region renowned for its abundant coal mines, I am acutely aware of the environmental challenges accompanying such prosperity. The significant coal mining activities and subsequent coal combustion in the area have precipitated severe environmental issues. I vividly recall days when the air pollution index soared off the chart and witnessed friends grappling with pneumonia. Back then, I learned that Chemical Engineering plays a pivotal role in addressing such pressing issues, and this realization fueled my initial passion for the major. This fervor was further fueled when recent wildfires in Canada painted the skies orange and filled the air with pungent odors, invoking memories of my childhood. The juxtaposition of those recollections against the present reality solidified my unwavering commitment to dedicating my career to chemical engineering. My academic journey, from undergraduate studies to master's research experiences, has been firmly rooted in these concerns, propelling me toward the next step in my academic pursuit. To this end, I am deeply motivated to apply for the Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering at Columbia University, where I aspire to continue my research under the guidance of Prof. Kumar, with a focus on developing commercially viable nanoparticle-based membranes in the air purification sector that boast outstanding performance and are economically practical. With curiosity and desire to address the problems that concerned me, I deemed that exploring the intrinsic properties of substances themselves was essential. This led me to pursue a chemistry major in my undergraduate studies. This intellectual curiosity pushed me to a point where I was in the top 10% of students at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, I had the privilege of being admitted to the Zhiyuan Honors Program. This program's rigorous emphasis on foundational sciences provided me with a robust mathematical and scientific foundation. Concurrently, I delved into organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and polymer chemistry, immersing myself in these domains. Beyond the realm of academic study, I was determined to gain experience as a researcher in laboratories as early as possible. Consequently, toward the conclusion of my freshman year, I had 1 Yifan Qin the privilege of joining the SJTU Qiu Group, specializing in Precision Hierarchical Self-Assembly. After undergoing over 100 hours of training in research methodologies and experimental techniques, I embarked on my journey in polymer science research under the esteemed guidance of Prof. Huibin Qiu. In my first literature review research titled \""A Self-Assembly Pathway to Soft- matter Toroidal Nanostructures,\"" I provided an overview of toroidal nanostructure preparation, with a particular focus on the evolving self-assembly routes of soft materials. This hands-on involvement in polymer science, coupled with my profound interest in refining materials and integrating superior alternatives into industrial production, solidified my commitment to research in polymer nanocomposites and nurtured my aspiration to cultivate skills capable of translating innovative concepts into substantive research projects. Expanding my research horizons, I applied to the Zhiyuan Scholars Research Program. As the team leader, I independently formulated and presented the project proposal. Standing out among 50 research groups, we secured a project grant of 75,000 RMB for two years. Our objective was to pioneer nano-horticulture using poly(lactide) (PLLA) containing micellar brushes, leveraging the biocompatibility of PLLA for applications in biomedical domains such as antibacterial measures and cellular screening. Throughout this intricate journey, I significantly honed my practical skills. I employed an array of characterization tools, ranging from NMR, MALDI-TOF-MS, and GPC for determining the optimal polymerization degree of PLLA, to utilizing TEM and SEM for visualizing micelle morphology, whether in solution or on material surfaces. Furthermore, the project cultivated my inventive spirit, compelling me to design a myriad of experiments to unravel the assembly dynamics of block copolymers in solution. My studies and research provided me with a solid chemistry foundational theory and practical skills for crafting high-performance polymer materials. Yet, a gap exists between laboratory studies and industrial use. This spurred my pursuit of Chemical Engineering at Columbia University for a master's, enhancing engineering theories and computational chemistry for predicting material 2 Yifan Qin properties. Simultaneously, my dedication to addressing air purification and my profound interest in polymer nanocomposites and gas transport drove me to seek further advancement in my research pursuits. I became a part of Prof. Sanat K. Kumar's lab, investigating the impact of polyoligoanilines inclusion in poly (methyl acrylate) (PMA) containing graft nanoparticles (GNPs). Rheological measurements using small amplitude oscillatory shear (SAOS) were performed on the system. It was determined that modifying polyoligoanilines placement within GNPs indicated a huge impact on mechanical properties. My ongoing research primarily centers around the thorough exploration of the mechanical and gas transport characteristics of GNPs while incorporating varying proportions of free chains. Our objective rests upon the determination of the activation energy governing diverse gas permeabilities within discrete GNP membranes. This multifaceted endeavor combines meticulous experimentation with insightful analysis, aiming to uncover the intricate mechanisms through which free chains exert their influence on the gas permeability of GNP membranes. During my tenure in Prof. Kumar's laboratory, I not only acquired an extensive repertoire of characterization techniques for diverse properties of polymer films but also developed a keen ability to comprehend the inner workings of instruments in an engineering capacity. This journey encompassed grasping the design principles underpinning instruments such as gas permeation cells, and progressing toward the conceptualization and construction of setups for characterization. This learning extended beyond mere material characterization methods, delving into the realm of process engineering. This dimension of growth significantly appeals to me, marking a pivotal highlight in my academic journey. My continuous learning journey has led me to recognize the substantial potential of polymer nanocomposite membranes in applications concerning air purification and gas separation. Fueled by this realization, my aspirations drive me to pursue further research endeavors. Consequently, I'm enthusiastic about seeking admission to the Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering at 3 Yifan Qin Columbia University. My goal is to further investigate gas transport phenomena under the adept guidance of Prof. Kumar. Should I be granted the privilege of embarking on a Ph.D. journey, my forthcoming research will pivot toward the understanding of gas transport mechanisms. One of the avenues is to do high-pressure conditioning of membranes crafted from GNPs. This pursuit involves probing the mechanisms through which increased pressure heightens gas permeability and scrutinizing the enduring impact of this treatment. In closing, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for your meticulous consideration. This promises to be an enthralling and profoundly significant pursuit, one that I eagerly anticipate undertaking. 4"",""Resume"":""Yifan Qin 800 Park Avenue, Fort Lee, NJ 07024 (929) 989-7805 & yq2343@columbia.edu EDUCATION Columbia Engineering, Columbia University New York, NY Master of Science in Chemical Engineering 09/2022-present • Overall GPA: 4.0/4.0 • Courses: Transport in Fluid Mixtures, Soft Condensed Matter Zhiyuan College, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) Shanghai, CN Bachelor of Science in Chemistry (Zhiyuan Honors Program) 09/2018-06/2022 • Overall GPA: 85/100 | Senior GPA: 90.5/100 • Courses: Organic Chemistry, Polymer Chemistry, Physical Chemistry, Polymer composite ACHIEVEMENTS & AWARDS • Zhiyuan Honors Scholarship of Shanghai Jiao Tong University 12/2018; 12/2019; 12/2020;12/2021 • Scholarship of Shanghai Jiao Tong University 12/2019; 12/2020;12/2021 • First Prize in Shanxi Province, The 31st National Chemistry Competition for High School Students 10/2017 RESEARCH EXPERIENCES Transport and Mechanical Properties of Grafted Nanoparticles 02/2023-present Student Research Worker | Supervisor: Prof. Sanat K.

"978025776","{""SOP"":""Max Kearns Columbia University PhD Application To the Graduate Program Admissions Committee, I graduated in the Spring of 2020 from the University of Rochester with my undergraduate degree in Chemical Engineering, when Covid-19 had just begun and no one knew how long the pandemic era of learning would last. I decided to postpone my goal of earning a graduate degree and gain professional experience working in industry. In the two years I worked as a process engineer, I gained a deep appreciation for the role of chemical engineering in improving food quality and reducing the environmental impact of large manufacturing plants. During this time, I also witnessed many incredible innovations in the biotechnology industry – multiple vaccines, antibody therapies, and antiviral treatments emerged over a short time span of two years. It was a miraculous feat and inspired me to return to an innovative academic environment for my master’s degree in chemical engineering with a focus in biotechnology. Through technical coursework in tissue engineering, biological machine learning, and core chemical engineering subjects, I was able to develop new skills to implement in my research. I began working in the lab of Dr. Allie Obermeyer, where I had the opportunity to apply machine learning algorithms to synthetic biology problems. Working at this exciting intersection of fields expanded my research interests in synthetic biology, cellular engineering, and applied machine learning and motivated me to apply into the PhD program at Columbia University. My motivation to earn a doctorate degree is driven by both short-term and long-term goals – as a graduate student, I want to continue learning, be intellectually challenged, and contribute original work in the field of chemical engineering. My research experience in the lab of Dr. Allie Obermeyer solidified these goals. To enhance the quantitative analysis of E. coli cell 1 Max Kearns Columbia University PhD Application morphology using microscopy images, I developed a support vector machine (SVM) to classify whether individual cells were correctly segmented from their background. During this process, I experienced numerous programming challenges, struggled to take high quality images of fixed bacteria cells, and spent a large portion of the project figuring out how to manage the large data sets I was constructing. Ultimately, I wrote a MATLAB script to extract image data from more than 10,000 individual E. coli cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) with various charged peptide tags. To incorporate this training data into the SVM, I needed to produce high quality labels for my data. To accomplish this, I spent several weeks using my “human eye” combined with open-source software to manually label all 10,000 cells. Using this high-quality curated data set, I trained, validated, and tested the SVM. The overall classification accuracy was 85%, with a low false positive rate of 7%, which significantly improved the quantitative image analysis of bacteria cell morphology. It was immensely gratifying to achieve improved results after encountering numerous project obstacles. This experience has been a driving force for me to pursue challenging research as a doctoral student. In addition to gaining skills in molecular cloning, cell culture techniques, plasmid design, and microscopy, this project also introduced me to the exciting intersection of synthetic biology and machine learning. As a PhD student at Columbia University, I want to continue working on complex chemical and biological engineering problems. I believe my research interests in synthetic biology, cellular engineering, and applied machine learning would make me a strong candidate to do research in the labs of Professor Allie Obermeyer, Professor Scott Banta, and Professor Mijo Simunovic. 2 Max Kearns Columbia University PhD Application Earning a doctorate degree will fulfill a long-term goal of becoming a credible scientist with the ability to engage with other technical leaders. My goal is to use the skills from my PhD degree and consulting experience to start a business venture in the biotechnology industry. My previous industry experience exposed me to the high-intensity atmosphere of engineering proposals, client relationships, and technical presentations. Our clients, including several multibillion-dollar food and beverage companies in the U.S, tasked us with designing new manufacturing facilities and process lines. It was incredibly satisfying designing technical solutions for major clients, but I desired to work on problems of greater complexity and open- endedness. A doctoral degree will allow me to develop an expertise in a niche area of chemical engineering and approach emerging challenges in a methodical and technically rigorous way. These are the skills I want to develop to be a scientific leader in my future career.

"882259412","{""SOP"":""Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 1 Tieu Hoang Huan Pham Personal Statement Computer Science at Columbia University Intended program: PhD in Computer Science (M.S. leading into Ph.D.) From the vibrant streets of Saigon to the historic corridors of York, my academic and cultural journey has been a tapestry of diverse experiences. During my early days in York, the stark contrast between my Vietnamese upbringing and the British education system was not merely academic but also deeply cultural. I remember instances when classmates would share anecdotes from their childhood, rooted in British traditions, while I nostalgically recall the vibrant streets of Saigon during the Tet festival. Often, the cultural gap was as subtle as when jokes from Blackadder and Monty Python resonated deeply with the British students, leaving me puzzled. These moments, although seemingly trivial, painted a broader picture of the deep-seated differences that lay between our worlds. Yet, it was these very differences that shaped my resilience, adaptability, and unique perspective—qualities I believe are essential in the ever- evolving field of computer science. My time in the UK made me realize the immense difficulty of being a minority in a predominantly monocultural community, with structural rigidity that limited my ability to grow, particularly in computer science, as there was no access to this subject in my boarding school. Columbia, with its commitment to diversity and its esteemed computer science program, presents the ideal environment for someone like me, who values both cultural richness and academic rigor. Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 2 In the U.S., while I was finally navigating the intricate waters of computer science, I simultaneously grappled with understanding the American way of life. The concept of Thanksgiving, the emphasis on individualism, and even the spirited college sports culture were all novel to me. However, with each passing event, I took it upon myself to learn, adapt, and share my own stories, weaving a tapestry of shared experiences with my peers. Initially, I found computer science daunting because of its intricate logic and the precision it demanded. The abstract nature of algorithms and the initial hurdles of syntax felt foreign, contrasting starkly with the subjects I had previously studied. To bridge this gap, I adopted a proactive approach. I frequently visited professors during their office hours, spending extra time after class to clarify doubts and deepen my understanding. I also sought mentorship from senior students and dedicated countless hours to self-study. Collaborating with peers became a regular practice, allowing me to grasp complex concepts from multiple perspectives. This hands-on, collaborative approach not only helped me navigate the intricacies of the subject but also instilled in me resilience and a never-give-up attitude. From grappling with a basic “hello world” program in C++ to authoring a paper for the International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2023), my journey has been one of consistent growth. My experiences have equipped me with the resilience, curiosity, and collaborative mindset that I believe will allow me to thrive within Columbia’s outstanding computer science program. During the summer of 2023 at Hofstra, I joined Professor Wu and Professor John in applying machine learning in the neuro-imaging field. By using GAN and its various derivatives, we were hoping to see whether we could feed raw 4D functional MR data straight into GAN without preprocessing to determine whether they outperform traditional algorithms in classifying patients with schizophrenia. I was tasked with handling the raw 4D MR data and testing the various GAN Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 3 models. However, since we were working with 4D tensors, I was working on how to make a 2D slice. In weekly lab meetings, I was exposed to many exciting terminologies in the neuro- imaging field. I also assisted Professor Shan with a particular computer system project, evaluating Gemini performance under memory pressure. In the virtualized cloud, a huge page misalignment caused the application to perform poorly. To mitigate this problem, Professor Shan, in a previous paper, created Gemini, a subsystem that turns misaligned huge pages into well-aligned huge pages. I was tasked with expanding Gemini's use cases. I designed test cases to see how Gemini would perform under complex scenarios such as memory deduplication, memory ballooning, and swapping. In spring 2023, I chose to explore the application of machine learning in the mortgage sector for my honors thesis, guided by Professor Puerzer and Professor Lane. My interest in this area stems from the critical role mortgages play in determining homeownership and, by extension, the socio-economic mobility of individuals. As fintech companies increasingly harness AI and machine learning, I was alarmed by papers from the Journal of Financial Economics that highlighted the presence of algorithmic bias. Using statistical techniques, particularly the chi- square test, I was able to confirm disparities in mortgage approval rates across different demographics in New York. These findings have profound societal implications. If unchecked, these biases in machine learning models perpetuate systemic discrimination, further marginalizing already vulnerable groups. As computer scientists, we bear the responsibility to ensure that technology serves as an enabler of equity, not a perpetuator of bias. I enjoyed the learning process because it was more than just coding or data analysis; it was about understanding the real-world implications of our algorithms. Every line of code, every Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 4 dataset, and every model choice had the potential to impact lives. The interdisciplinary nature of my research, which involved finance and urban studies, further enriched my understanding. It made me realize that the challenges in machine learning are not just technical but deeply societal. I am eager to collaborate with Professor Bareinboim, the director of the Causal Artificial Intelligence Lab and a renowned expert in fairness analysis. His recent work, which delves into the intricate relationship between data, AI, and fairness, resonates deeply with my research interests. His innovative approach, melding causality language with legal doctrines involving discrimination, offers a promising avenue for addressing the biases inherent in modern AI systems. As I discuss in my thesis, Professor Bareinboim's emphasis on translating societal norms into measurable statistical terms could be invaluable. At Hofstra, my passion for computer science and mathematics was not confined to just my personal academic endeavors. Recognizing the challenging nature of these disciplines, I took on weekly tutoring roles in both the computer science and mathematics departments. This responsibility was about more than just knowledge dissemination; it required immense adaptability and patience. Every student, with their unique characteristics, meant that a one-size- fits-all approach would not suffice. I constantly innovated and tailored my teaching methods to cater to individual needs. Assisting international students added another layer of complexity. Language barriers, cultural nuances, and diverse educational backgrounds necessitated effective communication. Tutoring students from various countries, including Uganda, El Salvador, and the Philippines, I often found myself breaking down concepts differently, using relatable examples from their cultures, or rephrasing explanations until clarity was achieved. Through these sessions, I not only imparted knowledge but also learned immensely about diverse cultures, broadening my own perspective and understanding. It was a journey of not just guiding them Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 5 academically but also assisting them in navigating a new educational system, drawing parallels from my own experiences as an international student. Building on the cultural mosaic that my life has become, my journey has been underscored by the challenge of fostering inclusivity and understanding across diverse settings. The transition from a conservative household in Saigon to a British boarding school was my first taste of the challenge. In environments unfamiliar to one's upbringing, the potential to grow and innovate can sometimes feel stifled. Yet, these experiences, albeit difficult, underscored the importance of fostering a community that celebrates differences. In essence, to truly thrive, it is not just about integrating into a new society but enriching it with a diverse tapestry of perspectives that inspire transformative change. As I look ahead, I am drawn to New York City and Columbia, a global institution embodying this ethos of diversity and inclusivity. Seeking a PhD in computer science at Columbia, particularly through the MS leading to PhD track, will allow me to deepen my knowledge in the expansive realm of AI and machine learning and to contribute meaningfully to the community at the pinnacle of research. Even as an undergraduate, I have been driven by a desire to understand the state-of-the-art advancements in machine learning and AI, especially the role of fairness as these models transition from theory to real-world application. My primary objective is to conduct research that ensures that, as we advance in the domain of AI and machine learning, these technologies are applied ethically, prioritizing and protecting humanity's interests. I am particularly drawn to exploring the implications of AI in criminal justice, aiming to develop models that counteract racial biases in predictive policing; in healthcare, where I intend to design diagnostic algorithms that are inclusive of all demographic groups; and in financial services, where I plan to investigate and mitigate the effects of underlying prejudices in lending decisions. Tieu Hoang Huan Pham 6 Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about teaching and mentoring the next generation of computer scientists, emphasizing both technical expertise and ethical considerations. My long- term goal, post-PhD, is to secure a tenure-track position at a leading university where I can seamlessly blend groundbreaking research with transformative teaching. I am confident that my diverse experiences and the challenges I have overcome will enrich Columbia's community."",""Resume"":""Tieu Hoang Huan Pham Mineola New York, NY 11501 (347) 414-6644 • josephpham1406@gmail.com EDUCATION Hofstra University, Fred DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science, Hempstead, NY Bachelor of Science (Honors with Distinction), Computer Science and Mathematics; Dean’s list – all terms; GPA: 3.8 December 2023 Relevant Coursework: Abstract Algebra I, Real Analysis I, Probability and Statistics II, Linear Algebra, Algorithm and Design Analysis, Introduction to AI, Introduction to Programming Languages HONORS AND GRANTS Graduated summa cum laude (2023) Computer Science and Mathematics Departmental Honors (2023) Phi Beta Kappa (2023) Pi Mu Epsilon (2023) Pi Mu Epslion (2023) Hofstra University Provost Scholarship (2020) RESEARCH EXPERIENCE Hofstra University, Zucker School of Medicine Research Assistant, Summer 2023 Advisors: Professor Majnu John, Professor Yihren Wu Applied Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to neuro-imaging for Schizophrenia classification using raw 4D functional MR data.

"961615821","{""SOP"":""Jose Antonio Tolentino Veliz Statement of Purpose My affinity for programming began back in 2013 when I took my first programming courses. I was amazed exactly the moment when I could write a small C++ snippet that could trick a game to make users always win. Apparently, it was nothing transcendental; however, I had to study the physical laws that govern the virtual game environment to elaborate an algorithm that could solve the puzzle. Undoubtedly, that must have been a milestone that defined my growing interest in computers. Driven by this enthusiasm, in 2015 I joined Smart Machines Lab in charge of Professor Jose Oliden at CTIC-UNI, a tech club specializing in autonomous robotics and microsatellites. In September 2016, my team participated in the ARLISS tournament, launching a two-meter rocket size with a small Rover inside. The objective was to deploy the rover mid-air and then navigate it autonomously to a specific GPS coordinate in the Rock desert of Reno, Nevada. Afterward, I was awarded a scholarship to receive training in the CanSat program at the University of Hokkaido, where the focus was to develop and launch a nanosatellite up to 500 feet to perform telemetry. In subsequent years, my research focus shifted to Control Systems and Artificial Intelligence. In 2018, I presented a research thesis to control the water level on a multi-tank system utilizing a coupled PID controller with a Genetic Algorithm, where I successfully improved the performance of traditional control techniques. The effectiveness and reliability of my control system apparatus prompted me to file a patent for this implementation. In 2020, I launched a Startup called QbAI. Initially, I began doing research in collaboration with my university in the area of autonomous vehicles. The purpose was to lay the groundwork for the software implementation of an urban VTOL (Rail), which later turned into two papers published in 2021 and 2022. Parallel to this project, I was developing front-end and back-end applications for local clients. In 2022, I decided to launch a startup based in New Mexico called Scryper, because I was getting more international clients and wanted to broaden my market niche. My focus by then was clearer, I wanted to target the development of Software as a Service that can leverage LLM/ML and AI. Jose Antonio Tolentino Veliz In consideration of the foregoing, I’m aiming to study for a Ph.D. in Computer Science because I would like to propose solutions to critical problems that society deals with on a daily basis. For instance, in the area of transport, I started a project to study the implementation of an urban autonomous electric aircraft (RAIL) that is able to navigate to a desired destination, just by booking a ride via a mobile application. This idea was presented to Y Combinator this present year 2023, where I submitted the autonomous navigation software, the booking mobile application, and the aircraft’s structure design. Although there are many areas in this project that need research and development, like computer vision, fluid dynamics simulation, FPGA circuit board design, etc. I perceive that it’s completely achievable because, in the past, I followed a similar engineering process when I built the control system apparatus of my patent that is now used by hundreds of students at my university. Moreover, in a robotics application like the autonomous aircraft, it’s necessary to lean on sensor fusion to collect as much data as possible from cameras and sensors, and then process it according to the aircraft’s motion using powerful FPGAs and computer vision-oriented software. Hence, it’s crucial to define and study flight paths to prevent collisions because VTOLs will usually fly below commercial flights. In addition to those challenges, it is important to also consider the impact of weather conditions on the safe navigation of autonomous cars. Professor Baishakhi Ray's research, titled \""DeepTest: Automated Testing of Deep-Neural-Network-driven Autonomous Cars,\"" sheds light on this aspect. Their study revealed that traditional testing approaches often overlook critical faults in DNN models, leading to potential accidents in autonomous cars. Recognizing the significance of this issue, Professor Ray and her team introduced DeepTest as a solution to enhance the efficiency and code coverage of testing in autonomous cars, achieving an impressive 99.6% coverage, and contributing to making autonomous cars safer and more reliable on the road. Computer vision captivates my attention and I am eager to explore its diverse application areas, such as generating code, images, or realistic video and photo renders. For instance, Professor Carl Vondrick and his team, in their paper titled \""ViperGPT: Visual Inference via Python Execution for Reasoning,\"" introduced an innovative model that improves visual inference accuracy by 87% precision. In their work, they demonstrated that their model leverages efficient Python execution that exhibits a remarkable 4.5x speed improvement compared to traditional processes. Surprisingly, these Jose Antonio Tolentino Veliz exceptional outcomes are attained with just an image as input, highlighting the model's versatility and potential impact across various applications. I have come across an application idea called UnrealCode, which is the line of the aforementioned research. UnrealCode aims to be a platform that creates code based on drawing blocks. Since I have been in the development of Front-end and Back- end, I have experienced the repetitive task of writing code for modules that are already defined. For instance, the code to create a user in Django is already implemented, so why not generate these models through front-end design? The procedure would be that a user draws blocks, for example, a login form and the LLM generates the front-end and back-end ready-to-use code according to the parameters of the form’s graphical design, such as font color, sizes, position of images, buttons, etc. To conclude, after my studies, I plan to put into practice my knowledge in the technology industry or by launching software services through a startup. I’m utterly sure my professional experience and academic research will fit in a Ph.D. in Computer Science like the one offered at Columbia University, where I have found that my projects are closely related to their recent publications."",""Resume"":""JoseAntonioTolentinoVeliz joseatolentinov@gmail.com|joseatolentino.com|github.com/jatolentino|linkedin@joseatolentino|Lima,Peru|+51997008163 EXPERIENCE ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Scryper,NewMexico,USA Jan.2022-Present SoftwareEngineer(remote) ● IntegrateLargeLanguageModels(LLMs)intowebandmobilesapplications,facilitatingadvancedsearchand recommendationfeaturesthatledtoa30%increaseinuserengagement(OpenAI,SpringBoot,Django,andFlutter) ● DevelopinteractiveandintuitiveuserinterfaceusingReactandReduxforadatavisualizationplatformandimplement dynamiccomponents,anduser-friendlynavigation,resultingina25%decreaseinbouncerates ● LeverageNLPtechniquestodevelopintelligentchatbotsforcustomersupport,reducingresponsetimesby50%and improvingcustomerflowby25%(OpenAIAPI) QbAI,Lima,Peru Jan.2020-Dec.2021 FullStackEngineer ● LedthedevelopmentofarobustRESTfulAPIusingDjangoandPythonforaSaaSplatform,achievinganaverage responsetimeofunder100msandhandlingover10,000requestsperminute.Implementedcachingmechanismsand loadbalancingstrategiestoensurehighavailabilityandfaulttoleranceofthesystem ● ImplementedascalablebackendsystemusingJavaandSpringBootforane-commerceplatform,resultingina50% increaseinconcurrentusersanda30%decreaseinresponsetime.Employeddatabaseindexingandcaching techniquestooptimizequeryperformance,enhancingoverallsystemefficiency AutomationLab,Lima,Peru Jan.2017-Dec.2019 ControlandBackendEngineer ● IntegratedFPGAboardswithKubernetesclusterstoenablehigh-speeddataprocessingforreal-timecontrolsystems andleveragedFPGA'shardware-levelparallelismandKubernetes'orchestrationcapabilitiestoachievesub-millisecond responsetimes,improvingsystemresponsivenessandensuringprecisecontrolintime-criticalapplications ● DesignedandimplementedascalableedgecomputinginfrastructureusingKubernetesandFPGA-basededgedevices, resultingina40%reductionindatatransferlatencyandimprovedreal-timedecision-makingcapabilities ● Implementedahighlyavailableandfault-tolerantIoTplatformusingKubernetesandDocker,resultingina50% decreaseinsystemdowntimeandimprovedreliabilityofdatacollectionfromthousandsofIoTdevices EDUCATION ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ NewYorkUniversity Sep.2022 MSc.inComputerEngineering(Droppedout) NationalUniversityofEngineering Mar.2012-Jul.2018 BS.inMechatronicsEngineering Thesis:“Design,andImplementationofaControlStrategyforNon-linearModelsAppliedtoanIndustrialProcessina Multi-TankSystem,BasedonaGeneticAlgorithm” RESEARCHEXPERIENCE ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ InformationTechnology,andCommunicationsCenter(CTIC-UNI),Lima,Peru Jan.2016-Aug.2016 EmbeddedSystemsIntern ● Developedandprototypedprintedcircuitboardsforroboticsapplications CanSatLeadershipTrainingProgram, UniversityofHokkaido,Japan Apr.2016-Oct.2016 ● Developed,launchedanddeployedananosatelliteinacanthatperformstelemetryat500ft ARLISSCompetition,Nevada,UnitedStates Sep2016-Oct.2016 ● DevelopedaminiaturizedroverthatnavigatesautonomouslytoaGPSpredefinedtargetinthedesert PROJECTS ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ Rover:AutonomousroverthatcanavoidobstaclesandnavigatetoaGPScoordinate.Status:completed CanSat:Nanosatelliteinacanthatperformstelemetry.Status:completed LittleVid:VideotoImageandTextsummarization.Status:beta DBot:AIchatbotthatcanqueryproduct'sstockonthedatabaseandreplybacktousers.Status:completed Rail:ElectricAutonomousUrbanVTOLforasinglepassengerwithmobileapp.Status:ondevelopment SmileMe:Transferasmileexpressiontoanonsmileyfacephoto.Status:beta Faang150:DrawandcodeonawebIDEwithastyluspenontouchscreendevices.Status:alpha AutoZoom:ApplyautomaticzoomondesiredareasinanX-raysurgeryprocedure.Status:ondevelopment NERF:SocialNetworkthatusesNERFtechnologiestoanimatefacephotos.Status:ondevelopment DubbAI:Dubbingvideostransferringemotionfromonelanguagetoanotherwithlipsync.Status:ondevelopment UnrealCode:Generatefront-endandback-endcodecomponentsfromgraphicsdesign.Status:ondevelopment PATENT ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯ IoTIndustrialLiquidLevelControlSystem,002191-2019/DIN Issued:April2021 ApparatusthatcontrolsliquidlevelinacascadetanksystembymeansofanFPGAandenablesuserstoimplementtheir owncontrolstrategyorAIalgorithmapproach.Valuedat100thousandUSD.

My combined interests in mechanical and biomedical engineering align well with the research conducted by some of your faculties, such as Professor Sunil K. Agrawal, who trains robots to aid humans in regaining or improving functional movements. Given my academic and research background, I am eager to pursue a Ph.D. that prioritizes in-depth study and creative problem-solving. I am particularly excited about the chance to contribute to the field of robotics for biomedical purposes at your distinguished institution. The blend of cutting-edge research, respected faculty, and vibrant academic community there provides an ideal environment for achieving academic and research excellence. Ever since I was young, I've been fascinated by biology, mathematics, and physics. This led me to the field of biomedical engineering, which beautifully combines these subjects, ensuring ongoing learning and innovative work. Biomedical engineering is ever-changing, keeping things fresh and offering the rewarding potential of enhancing people's health. I've grown to love both prototyping and software development because of the field's interdisciplinary nature. My academic journey has been driven by a strong enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research. The focus of my current master’s degree has been on fiber optic sensors used in minimally invasive procedures, especially for diagnosing and treating occlusive arterial disease and prostate cancer. Jacynthe Francoeur Under the supervision of Professors Samuel Kadoury and Raman Kashyap, I designed a fiber optic sensor with the aim of integrating it into medical tools and robotic systems for multimodal sensing, like flexible needles and catheters. This work highlights my expertise in fiber optics and various detection methods, while also drawing connections between my research interests and the work of Prof. Sunil K. Agrawal, for instance. I'm driven by a profound passion for research, motivating me to pursue a Ph.D. in your program with an emphasis on medical robotics. This degree is not just another qualification for me; it represents a foundational step in my career. Undertaking it will not only deepen my expertise in the field but also expand my career prospects in both academia and the industry, perfectly aligning with my long-term aspirations. While I cherish my Canadian roots, the unparalleled academic and research opportunities in the U.S. make relocating a compelling choice. The U.S. is particularly appealing because of its robust support for biomedical research, fostering a vibrant atmosphere for innovation. I am particularly attracted to industry roles in biomedical engineering due to their structured environments, allowing me to concentrate on research and innovation without the administrative burdens often found in academia. Ultimately, earning a Ph.D. from a prestigious institution like yours would set the stage for a rewarding career that balances professional achievements with personal well-being. During my academic journey, I've been lucky to win many scholarships. Some notable ones came from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Fonds de recherche du Québec Nature et technologies (FRQNT). Among these, the Fayolle Canada United States’ Prestige scholarship really stands out. Only two students from Polytechnique Montreal get Jacynthe Francoeur this each year. With this scholarship, I got to do a five-month internship at Johns Hopkins University. There, I worked closely with Prof. Iulian Iordachita at the Laboratory for Computational Sensing and Robotics (LCSR). We created a special needle with fiber Bragg grating strain sensors for certain prostate procedures. We then shared our findings in a paper for the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) in 2024. Furthermore, one of the standout moments in my academic journey was my participation on a project closely tied to my master's research with Boston Scientific. This collaboration led to several achievements: a presentation at the Optical Sensors and Sensing Congress 2022, a poster at COPL 2022 Annual Day, and a special edition publication in Optics Express in 2023. This project and the related articles show both my success and my strong commitment to making advances in biomedical engineering. Together, my work with Boston Scientific and Johns Hopkins University has made me excited to pursue further studies as a Ph.D. student in medical robotics in the United States. During my undergraduate years, I was deeply involved in numerous research projects, supported by scholarships that enabled me to intern at various labs at Polytechnique Montreal. Here, I delved into diverse topics such as data science, ultrasonic imaging, nanoparticles, and lasers. A highlight of my experiences was designing a robot for scoliosis correction, which not only solidified my interest in robotics but also equipped me with invaluable hands-on knowledge.

"544600210","{""SOP"":""Personal Statement Prospective Ph.D. Student Department of Computer Science, Columbia University Dr. Frederick Sanger famously stated, ”Scientific research is one of the most exciting and rewarding of occupations,” and those words have reverberated within me, igniting a powerful aspiration in my heart. Starting from modest origins in my home country, Bangladesh, I set out on a journey to the USA for my master’s degree, but that was only the beginning. As I delved deeper into my studies, my curiosity grew stronger, propelling me toward a loftier goal: a PhD. This evolution from an eager student to a resolute researcher has been a deliberate journey, not a mere coincidence. From the outset, my commitment to academic pursuits has been unwavering. During my formative years, an affinity for mathematics and physics guided me towards the realm of engineering. This inclination led to my acceptance into both a reputable medical institution and a distinguished engineering university. The importance of this accomplishment is amplified when seen through the perspective of my country’s limited educational possibilities for young women, where pursuing a career in engineering remains an unusual decision. Undaunted by societal expectations, I embraced the challenge and became the first female engineer in my family. My path commenced at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET), a place well- known for its academic excellence, and laid the foundation for my research journey. I got involved in various projects and academic events during my time as an undergraduate, and that sparked my love for research. The recognition I got from publishing research papers on international platforms laid a solid foundation for the research work I continue to do. This journey reflects my determination, supported by a strong belief in the importance of education and research. Transitioning to the USA, the exposure to a diverse array of backgrounds significantly broadened my horizons. My tenure at Texas A&M University introduced me to the Sketch Recognition Lab (SRL) under the guidance of Dr. Tracy Hammond. This environment nurtured my academic growth and became the fertile ground for exploring my research interests. My focus gravitated toward projects involving eye tracking and educational technologies. Beyond their technical dimensions, I was captivated by the inherent humanitarian implications of these initiatives. This realization solidified my aspiration to apply my knowledge to effect tangible change in people’s lives. This sentiment was further reinforced by witnessing a lab mate, who is visually impaired, actively pursuing a Ph.D. to contribute to disability- focused research. AsIsoughttodivedeeperintodifferentfieldsofcomputerscience,IexploredNaturalLanguageProcessing (NLP) under the direction of Dr. Ruihong Huang. This quest led me to work on a project on multi- evidence natural language inference for clinical trials. Moreover, I participated in Dr. James Caverlee’s InformationStorageandRetrieval(IR)coursetoextendmyknowledgeandworkedonaprojectthataims toboostclinicaltrialeffectivenessbyimprovingpatient-trialmatching. Thesuccessfulcompletionofthese two projects encouraged me to explore the application of NLP and IR techniques in the clinical domain as my master’s thesis. My thesis has two primary objectives: firstly, to determine textual entailment or contradictionofsomeclinicalhypothesiswithrespecttocorrespondingclinicaltrialreports, andsecondly, toretrieveasetoffactualinformationfromthetrialreportsconducivetoeffectivereasoningoftherelation. Adrita Anika Thepotentialimpactofthisresearchissignificant, asitaimstogreatlyenhancethecapabilitiesofhealth- care professionals in aligning the latest evidence with personalized treatment approaches. To realize the ambitious goal of effective evidence retrieval, I have undertaken an extensive analysis focused on the effec- tive integration of context considering the limitations of the maximum input number of tokens of SOTA language models. I have submitted my findings from this study to one of the most prestigious AI confer- ences, the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2024. Furthermore, my efforts have encompassed theinfusionofdiseaseknowledgeintolanguagemodels. Ihavealsoexploredtheapplicationofcontrastive learningtechniquestodeviseanefficientmethodfornaturallanguageinference, particularlywhendealing with lengthy and intricate clinical trial data. These combined endeavors represent a concerted effort to advance the state-of-the-art in healthcare information processing and reasoning, with the ultimate aim of benefiting both practitioners and patients in the medical domain. Continuing my commitment to skill improvement, I decided to dive into a comprehensive course on Data Analytics and Visualization. Under the guidance of experienced mentors, Dr. John Keyser and Dr. Ann McNamara, I undertook a project focused on the analysis of traffic collisions in the bustling city of New York. The encouragement and support I received from the mentors motivated me to participate in the Disney Data and Analytics Conference 2022. It is with great pride that I share the accomplishment of winning the Disney Data and Analytics Women Award for 2022. This milestone not only granted me firsthand exposure to the transformative power of data analysis but also enhanced my practical expertise in the field of data science. To complement my academic pursuits, I set foot in the industry through internships as a Machine Learning Engineer at Tenstorrent Inc. and as a Data Scientist at Amazon Robotics. These roles gave me the chance to apply the theoretical knowledge I had gained to real-world scenarios, thereby refining my technical skills and nurturing effective teamwork and communication abil- ities. Concurrently, my role as a teaching assistant allowed me to further polish my project management, leadership, and teamwork skills. Throughout my transformative journey in the USA, which has encompassed diverse experiences ranging from intensive research projects, and demanding coursework to valuable internships, I can confidently assertthatthispathhasbeenanythingbutsmooth. Balancingteaching, research, andcourseworkamidst COVID-19 disruptions and a change in major from bachelor’s to master’s degrees has taught patience, resilience, and adaptability. Notably, I had the privilege of undergoing the CliftonStrengths psychometric assessment from Texas A&M University, which illuminated my core strengths—maximizer, relator, and empathy. Fueled by these attributes, I am steadfastly dedicated to achieving both personal and collective excellence, as I diligently prepare for the forthcoming Ph.D. journey that lies ahead. As I contemplate the next stage of my academic journey, my attention is firmly fixed on Columbia Uni- versity, an institution of great renown distinguished by its size, reputation, and commitment to academic excellence. With a profound research interest in harnessing the powers of machine learning, natural lan- guage processing, and information retrieval to drive transformative change, I see Columbia University as the ideal stage for nurturing my aspirations. I am particularly captivated by the opportunity to engage in collaborative research within Dr. Noémie Elhadad’s lab. Their research resides at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and medicine, aligning seamlessly with my prior MSc. research experience. My passion lies in developing techniques that empower clinicians, patients, and health researchers to streamline their information workflows and derive invaluable insights from clinical data. Dr. Elhadad’s research, focused on supporting clinical decision-making, truly intrigues me. In addition, I am keenly interested in the research of Dr. Elias Bareinboim, whose expertise centers on causal inference and its applications in the biomedical domain. His recent work on fairness analysis in the context of causal inference greatly motivates me and closely aligns with my own research interests. Furthermore, I find Dr. Zhou Yu’s research particularly compelling. Her work delves into the intersection of natural language processing with real-world applications, which greatly piques my interest. Several Adrita Anika of her research endeavors resonate with my research interests, experience, and expertise. This potential collaboration promises a robust platform for exploring and unraveling intricate patterns within extensive datasets, shedding light on complex interconnections. In summary, my journey—from Bangladesh to the USA—has shaped an individual characterized by unwavering dedication, a passion for research, and adeptness in navigating challenges. I have become more resilient as a result of experiencing hardship and learning. The epitome of academic greatness is Columbia University, where I want to continue my journey, expand my knowledge, and genuinely leave my imprint via my contributions to research.

"432789225","{""SOP"":""Cynthia Wu In a neuroscience elective in high school, I learned that doctors monitored epilepsy in patients using the voltage across time in EEGs. Around the same time, CTRL-Labs was prototyping wristbands to detect intent in impulses traveling through the wrist. I felt certain that in electrical engineering, I would find the window to the brain. Today, Synchron’s stentrode and “brain.io” is in clinical trials, taking signals directly from blood vessels in the brain to allow paralyzed individuals to control computers. I learned of this new technology in the first year of my master’s degree in electrical engineering and became convinced that not only would this field provide a window to the brain, it would become integral to supporting its functions. With this in mind, I volunteered for Dr. Dion Khodagholy’s Translational NeuroElectronics Lab at Columbia University in the second semester of my master’s degree. During this time, I learned of the effects of sleep and epilepsy on memory in rats as well as the closed-loop methods used to treat it. As such, I’m deeply invested in uncovering the mysteries underlying the formation and consolidation of memory and how they present themselves as electrical measurements. Not only is the puzzle of memory intriguing, understanding it would be crucial in aiding the health and quality of life for many patients, such as those with Alzheimer’s or epilepsy. In the context of human health, the study of the brain becomes extremely interdisciplinary, merging everything from electrical and mechanical engineering to biology and neuroscience to statistics and deep learning. Columbia’s electrical engineering program merges all these topics in both its coursework and research labs, and this is why I am applying to this PhD program in electrical engineering. In terms of courses, during my master’s at Columbia, I have had the pleasure of taking many courses on processing signals from a variety of fields, from Dr. Aurel Lazar’s class on circuits in the brain (BMEB W4020) to Dr. Nima Mesgarani’s class on speech processing (ELEN E6820). This year, Dr. John Wright’s class on sparse and low-dimensional models for high-dimensional data (ELEN E6001) has been enlightening for my efforts working for the Translational NeuroElectronics Lab. I hope that during a potential doctorate at Columbia, I can better understand the research I am contributing to with classes such as Dr. Ching-Yung Lin’s class on big data analytics (EECS E6893) and Dr. Predrag Jelenkovic’s class on statistical learning and biological and information systems (EECS E6690). I also hope to learn Cynthia Wu about biocompatible devices which acquire bioelectronic signals from classes such as Dr. Dion Khodagholy’s device nanofabrication class (ELEN E6945). In terms of research, I plan to continue studying memory consolidation and closed-loop treatments for epilepsy at the Translational NeuroElectronics Lab. Through this lab, I aim to both further investigate analytical methods to quantify physiological and pathological signals, as well as build from the developments of new biocompatible and conformable implantable probes. During my time as a researcher, I’ve been captivated by the various ways to quantify the pathology of NREM signals in both the time and frequency domain, all while contributing to the development of closed-loop treatments. I hope to dedicate my potential doctorate to both further investigating explainable ways to explore sleep signals as well as to examine the application of machine learning techniques with the goal of further uncovering the information between the neocortex and the hippocampus. I’m especially curious about investigating how techniques from extreme value theory can be applied to the quantification of such communication, especially as compared to techniques using measures of center. I’m also curious about exploring whether machine learning techniques will correlate with either or both types of measures in NREM signals. But I don’t just want to investigate these topics because they are interesting—I also feel that the exploration of memory as it relates to various parts of the brain is intimately tied to the human experience. Memory is so much of what makes us, us. For this same reason, I also find Dr. Jennifer Gelinas’ research on the connection between epilepsy and memory and the features of neurodevelopmental disorders compelling. Dr. Gelinas’ research makes inquiries on how memory is disturbed by epilepsy. I’m curious about the insights into memory that treatment of said disturbance could provide. By observing and treating what is pathological, perhaps it is possible to discover patterns in the electrophysiological data which hint at what governs memory physiologically. These are all questions at the intersection of health and electrical engineering which I am excited to explore. I hope that my experience with investigating pathological and physiological NREM signals in time and frequency domains equips me to contribute to either Dr. Khodagholy’s Translational NeuroElectronics Lab or Dr. Gelinas’ Epilepsy and Cognition Lab. Cynthia Wu Both the research and coursework at Columbia represent what I’ve been looking for in an electrical engineering degree, touching on everything from the devices which interface with the brain to the analysis of the acquired cues. It is the culmination of what I’ve been looking forward to exploring since the moment I learned the brain fired electrical impulses. I look forward to discovering new windows of insight into memory and learning in the brain so that in the future, I can pursue a post-doctorate at the Zuckerman Institute or at the Friedman Brain Institute."",""Resume"":""CYNTHIAWU PermanentAddress:109-2371stRd#4JForestHills,NY11375 Email:cynthia789wu@gmail.com Cell:1(516)366-9713 Education Sep.2022-Dec.2023 M.S.inElectricalEngineeringatColumbiaUniversity (GPA: 4.073/4.33) Aug.2018-May2022 B.E.inElectricalEngineeringatStonyBrookUniversity,SummaCumLaude (GPA:4.0/4.0) Employment May2022-Aug2022 ComputationalPathologyInternatPfizer:Improvedimageprocessing workflowsbycreatingPythonscriptstotransform.cziand.svsfilesinto.tif files.

"001160467","{""SOP"":""Xiaoyu Zhao My love for Raman imaging began when I was a first-year bachelor student at Imperial College London. At that time, I was a huge fan of Professor Molly Stevens, and she kindly accepted me to join her group. My resume was very fortunately picked up by Dr. Vernon LaLone, who later became my supervising postdoc for the next 3 years. I had no idea what Raman imaging was at that time, but I always saw the sparkles in Vernon’s eyes whenever he talked about Raman imaging. It was probably one of my luckiest decisions because over the next 3 years, we developed one of the top Raman technologies in the world—the ultra- quantitative Raman analysis method. This method transformed semi-quantitative Raman analysis to a fully quantitative level in terms of concentration. We became the first group in the world that could visualise the 3D distribution of drug metabolism and drug deposition within human liver organoids without any need for sample preparation. Our first and only paper was published in Cell Reports Methods in April 2023, and all the Raman data in this paper were processed and generated by myself. The paper soon received comments from Professor Lev T. Perelman from Harvard University for its significance in the medical field. Vernon went back to the US after my bachelor's study finished. I was very worried that nobody would answer my questions after Vernon left, so I found his supervisor, Dr. Conor Horgan, who was working at a spin-out company from King's College London called HyperVision Surgical. The company focused on hyperspectral imaging for tumor detection and anastomotic leakage. I immediately applied for an internship position and explained to the team how I developed the algorithm for ultra-quantitative Raman imaging. I received the offer during the interview and soon started working part-time throughout my entire master's degree. I worked during the day and caught up with my studies at night. I felt extremely excited, tired, but blessed during that time. Towards the conclusion of my studies at Imperial College London, I attained a First-Class Honours degree in Xiaoyu Zhao Biomedical Engineering and secured UROP scholarships for three consecutive years. Additionally, I earned an honorary appointment at King's College London and received a UK National Health Service honorary appointment at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in recognition of my contributions at HyperVision Surgical. I felt extremely lucky because this small company turned out to be one of the fastest-growing startups in London and was presented at the annual NVIDIA GTC 2022 keynote by CEO Jensen Huang as part of the “I am a visionary” section. Within one year, we started with the basic algorithm and finished with 90 in-patient studies, including 9 colorectal surgeries and 81 neurosurgeries. The company grew extremely fast, and I learned huge amounts of knowledge from everyone on the team. My CEO, Dr. Michael Ebner, showed me the possibility of starting my own startup company with the technology I love. After my Raman algorithm was fully developed, I kept looking for a suitable application for it. At that time, the best image I generated was of some human-engineered cartilage samples from a research group at ETH Zurich. I showed my Raman results to Professor Marcy Zenobi-Wong, and I obtained a Ph.D. position in her lab. However, after I finished my last experiment for an animal study in which we implanted the human-engineered cartilage subcutaneously under the rats, I noticed a huge problem from the samples through my Raman analysis. Almost all the glycogen within the cells got depleted, which means the engineered cartilage samples will die in a matter of time. Although the cartilage culture didn’t go very well, my Raman analysis was always beautiful! During my time at ETH, I became the organizing committee of the 6th Raman workshop and got the opportunity to present my work. It was my happiest day when I received an email from our sponsor, Dr. Mirjana Dimitrievska, who is the group leader at Empa, Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology: 'I had a hard time deciding on the 3rd candidate, as in the other Xiaoyu Zhao abstracts I feel that Raman spectroscopy plays a side role, and it is more used as a general technique to support the project, rather than the center of it. Honestly, I think that it might be a good idea to keep Xiaoyu Zhao as an applicant and give her the award in the end, as her work is more deserving than the other applications. She presents a different aspect of Raman spectroscopy that could potentially have a high impact in health and medicine, and I think it deserves to be acknowledged, especially as it seems better than the other 4 candidates. Also, as you are giving 3 awards, I think it is okay that she is in the organizing committee and getting it. We need to support good work, and she is doing it, so I feel that it is fair.' As a technique that is extremely new but is for sure a transforming tool, Dr. Dimitrievska’s comment encouraged me a lot because it was a journey that is extremely work-intensive but pays back very little in the first couple of years. I had no interest at all in culturing cartilage, and I was kept amazed by Professor Wei Min’s work. The primary limitation with my current technique lies in the hardware; spontaneous confocal Raman microscopy is an extremely slow tool, and the majority of my images took 8-20 hours to finish. However, with the stimulated Raman imaging system that Professor Min has developed, images could be taken within minutes. I always wanted to combine my algorithm with a stimulated Raman imaging system and increase my imaging speed. I also had a huge desire for a Professor who could teach me more about biological Raman imaging, especially about the hardware. I believe Raman imaging stands as a highly promising method for addressing various challenges in biological research. Its unique non-invasive nature makes it the only technique capable of investigating living samples and leaving them intact. Despite my enthusiasm for Raman, I am fully aware that there is a huge gap exists in my understanding, and I recognise that mastering the construction of a stimulated Raman microscope Xiaoyu Zhao compatible with my software demands a more comprehensive skill set. Therefore, a PhD with a specific focus in the field of biological Raman imaging would be necessary for me to delve deeper in analytical chemistry. I had an interview with Professor Min and got his full support for a Ph.D. position at Columbia University. I immediately quit my Ph.D. at ETH and started to self-study the fundamental knowledge in photonics and chemistry. I also lead a team to launch the first online platform for biological Raman analysis with the aim to fully understand the best application for quantitative Raman imaging. During the gap period, I attended many competitions in China and received many awards. I met all the companies in China who are working in the field of Raman, and got many samples for independent investigation. This hands-on experience solidified my conviction that biological Raman analysis is a vital asset for the imaging market, and I foresee Raman becoming a dynamic and rapidly expanding field in the coming years. Having spent five years immersed in Raman research, I am certain that it is my lifelong passion. For the next five years, I want to do more research, promote biological Raman analysis in the scientific fields and show more people that Raman analysis has an indispensable role in basic research. I am eager to join Columbia University to further my knowledge in super multiplexed Raman imaging, with the ultimate goal of developing the most advanced Raman imaging system in the near future."",""Resume"":""""}","[{""project"":""Ultra-Quantitative Raman Analysis Method"",""description"":""Developed the world's first method for fully quantitative Raman analysis that allows visualization of the 3D distribution of drug metabolism and deposition within human liver organoids without any sample preparation."",""skills"":""Raman imaging techniques, data processing, algorithm development, 3D visualization, scientific writing."",""research_area"":""Biomedical Informatics and Computational Biology""},{""project"":""Hyperspectral Imaging for Tumor Detection"",""description"":""Interned at HyperVision Surgical, working on hyperspectral imaging associated with tumor detection and anastomotic leakage.

"285518974","{""SOP"":""KORALLA NAGA VENKATA CHANDRASEKHAR Structural analysis and its application to perform optimisation is fast expanding its horizons with new methods used to precisely represent the geometry using splines and to perform analysis to determine the energy stored by the structure. Newer criteria have been identified to check for the safety of the structure. I am interested to continue on my research work in the area of the structural analysis with optimisation. The use of optimisation to determine the layout of the steel within the reinforced concrete domain is one of the significant application of optimisation. The distribution of material at the ultimate elastic limit is the result of the topology optimisation. The forces carried by the structure at this optimal point of convergence is of practical significance. For example, to determine the prestressing force in a bridge pier will help the Engineer to know the magnitude of the tensile forces at the elastic limit. The application of optimisation to determine the optimal water pipe line network for a city is also one of the best examples in Civil Engineering. I have worked for several years as a teaching faculty at my home place in Hyderabad, India teaching both Undergraduate and Graduate students in Civil Engineering. I have taught several subjects as Strength of Materials I & II, Structural Analysis I & II, Advance Structural Analysis, Numerical Methods in Structural Engineering, Finite Element analysis. Conducted laboratory for Undergraduate and Graduate students in Strength of Materials Laboratory, Finite Element Analysis Laboratory. I have worked in the area of Topology Optimisation of continuum structures. I have worked on finite element analysis to analyse continuum structures. I have published a few papers in the topology optimisation of continuum structures. My intent to pursue my further study and research work in the field of computational mechanics is never ending. I see there is no possibility of any funding. I have a strong intent to continue my research work and explore further areas of study. I cannot live without research work simply taking classwork and grading is not what I want to do. Life without exploring new avenues and challenges is a stand still. I would like to put my thoughts to work on new ideas is all I want to do. I have started studying on advamced structural analysis and structural optimisation in my first semester at IIT in the year 1998. Did not understand much at that time but it was something interesting and challenging. The problems were too lengthy to solve by hand and there is lot of mathematical work required for each problem to determine the area of steel required. There is lot of focus on mathematics in my education since my high school. Mathematics is an integral part of many subjects in some form and required to analyse and solve the problems. The subject of Structural Optimisation is quite interesting in the sense it is used in several fields of study. In reinforced concrete member, to determine the amount of steel satisfying the strength and serviceability conditions, to lower the cost of the steel required. In a two dimensional plate carrying in-plane loading, the plate is modelled using linear splines and the optimal distribution of material in the design domain is determined. I have worked with several people in India and outside India in the field of Structural Engineering and also from allied fields. I have seen people and students who are extremely talented and proven successful. I am not one of their kind but I am definitely hard working individual. I have been working on optimisation of different types of structures for several years now. Inverse buckling formulation to perform topology optimisation of continuum structures and determine the deformed profile at KORALLA NAGA VENKATA CHANDRASEKHAR KORALLA NAGA VENKATA CHANDRASEKHAR optimal state of convergence. The buckling criteria is used to check for statbility criteria to determine the buckling load factor. The buckling load factor can give us an information on how much load the structure can carry before the buckling occurs. The inverse of the buckling load is taken as the objective function and the deformed profile is determined at convergence. Cubic basis splines have been used to model the geometry of the structure and perform analysis to determine the nodal displacements at each node. The results of the nodal displacements were compared with the results obtained from finite element analysis using six node linear strain triangular elements. Structural mechanics, solid mechanics and materials division of Structural Engineering is the place I would like to work. I would like to do my work on computational analysis of structures, model the structures and determine the deflections and stresses. I will work on new methods to perform optimisation of continuum structures. I can continue my present work into non-linear analysis to determine the optimal distribution of material within the design domain. Computational analysis of structures is one area where I can use finite element analysis and I can do basic coding in ForTran, C, MatLab. I have worked on gradient methods and meta-heurisitic based methods to perform the analysis. I have used the conventional method such as first order sensitivity analysis using optimality criteria to perform optimisation of structures. Non-gradient based heurisitic methods to perform optimisation of structures using genetic algorithms, firefly algorithm are few methods which I have used to conduct my research work. I would like to pursue my research work in the area of reliablity based stochastic analysis of structures and perform non- linear topology optimisation to determine the optimal layout of material. About my background, I am born in a middle class family. My father is a state government employee and mother is a house wife. Monthly salary is the only source of income to live and I come from a modest background and education to prosper is the only way for me to live. I did my undergraduate in Civil Engineering at Hyderabad, India in the year 1994-98. I then continued to study my graduate study with Masters in Structural Enginerng at IIT Bombay in the year 1998-00. I pursued my graduate studies with Masters in Business Administration from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD in the year 2004-06. The applications of structural optimisation has to reach the day to day life of an individual. Not many people have any know-how in this area of study. I came across a few who say Topology optimisation is just theoretical study. The study of optimisation should be encouraged in the regular class work of Undergraduate and Graduate study. The application of optimisation to Civil Engineering should be the part of the course work. The modelling of different materials in a concrete mix to determine the material properties of the combined mix is one area where optimisation can be used. The use of machine learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms is showing a new way to the field of optimisation and structural optimisation as well. I would want to start a computational analysis laboratory along with the course work for Undergraduate and Graduate students in Engineering. Conduct research related to computational analysis in Engineering. The area of Structural Optimisation which is largely dependent on the using of computers to perform the analysis is one of the KORALLA NAGA VENKATA CHANDRASEKHAR KORALLA NAGA VENKATA CHANDRASEKHAR prime areas of Engineering where in the knowledge and insight into Civil Engineering, Mathematics and Computers are coming together. The idea to develop the computational analysis as a specialisation in Engineering which is across the disciplines of Engineering and which serves as an interdisciplinary.

"085541001","{""SOP"":""My parents asked me a question when I had just received my college offer: \""What is your life's goal? Is it money or position?\"" I couldn't provide an immediate answer, but this question continued to linger in my mind. During my junior year, I had the opportunity to intern at Beijing Automotive Group Co., Ltd. (BAIC), where I assisted in powertrain calibration. The job was enjoyable, but I yearned for more freedom in product development. Fortunately, during my graduate studies at Johns Hopkins, I was privileged to work in SMARTs lab. Although the resources and project scope at the university were incomparable to the vehicle design work at BAIC, I found immense satisfaction in the freedom to develop my projects. It was during this time that I came to understand my life's true goal. It wasn't about money or fame. As an engineer, my life's purpose is to create something beneficial for the world. This realization set me on a path to pursue a Ph.D. degree. I aspire to secure a research position in an institute or company, where I can explore new ideas and create innovations. A Ph.D. is the foundational step on this journey, leading me toward the fulfillment of my life's goal.\"" Based on my previous experience and my interesting. I want to join the Columbia University CS PHD Program and focus on MR Application/Robotics visual servoing or Visualization and Computer Graphics study. My Ph.D. career will build upon the knowledge and experience I gained during my master's program. I graduated from the JHU MSE Robotics program in May 2023, where I acquired a substantial foundation in robotics-related subjects and conducted research at LCSR. I gained expertise in various areas, including Linux, ROS (Robot Operating System), Unity, AR/VR development, gaze tracking, computer vision, and machine learning. I also have practical experience with the Da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). My involvement at JHU centered around two major research projects: the development of a robotic surgery first assistant training tool and the creation of a VR Virtual Dizziness Clinic. The robotic surgery first assistant training tool originated as a course project. I enrolled in the Computer Integrated Surgery II class, where I undertook a semester-long project under the guidance of Professor Peter Kazanzides. The project stemmed from the recognition that the role of the first assistant is pivotal in the success of robot-assisted surgeries. There was a lack of available simulators for first assistants to co-train with the primary surgeon who operates the robotic system. I initiated the project by focusing on instrument localization since knowing the precise location of instruments is essential for first assistants to interact accurately within the virtual environment. After evaluating various methods, considering factors such as accessibility, latency, accuracy, and minimizing modifications to the handheld instruments, I decided to employ a stereo camera and traditional computer vision techniques to address this challenge. Once I successfully obtained accurate instrument positions, I designed a pipeline to transmit this information to Unity using a UDP socket, allowing for the correct rendering of instruments within the Unity environment. The course project reached its conclusion due to time constraints, but I was determined to extract more value from the system. Consequently, I continued my work within the lab, aiming to enhance the system. I explored additional features, including endoscope localization via endoscope views, experimented with instrument detection using background subtraction, and attempted to use the disparity map to ascertain the status of the end effectors on the instruments. Although some of these endeavors faced challenges, like issues related to modeling and resource limitations, I successfully transitioned the system from Unity to the Asynchronous Multi-Body Framework (AMBF), an open-source simulation environment developed by research scientist Adnan Munawar at JHU. At this point, the system had evolved to effectively collaborate with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The initial results of this work were accepted and presented at the International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR). The second project originated from a collaboration with Dr. Kemar Green, a neuro- ophthalmologist. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Green encountered a significant challenge in telemedicine. For the accurate diagnosis of certain conditions, particularly those related to gaze patterns, neuro-ophthalmologists require precise gaze data. While gaze estimation is possible through video, the data obtained this way may not be as accurate as needed for diagnostic purposes. Unfortunately, sending specialized devices to patients' homes for these measurements was impractical. To address this issue, a solution using off-the-shelf hardware became essential. I conducted a rapid assessment of the task and developed a prototype using the HoloLens 2, which offered a simple user interface and automated data collection, ensuring the quantitative and accurate analysis of gaze patterns. This project is still ongoing, with the initial work aimed at presentation at the IEEE VR conference. Both projects were primarily undertaken by me under the guidance of Professor Peter Kazanzides. Professor Peter provided the overarching vision and valuable insights. I was responsible for designing the pipeline, writing, testing, and debugging the code, as well as creating and modifying the hardware and phantom models. I also received significant assistance from numerous research scientists at the LCSR Lab. This experience allowed me to step out of my comfort zone, beyond classroom learning, and acquire a wealth of new knowledge from practical research. As I reflect on my journey, I find immense satisfaction not only in the outcomes but also in the personal growth I've achieved. My foray into the world of robotics began in the fall of 2021, at a point when I had limited knowledge of Linux, ROS, AR, and computer vision. However, over time, I not only acquired expertise in these areas but also developed the skills to facilitate communication between programs, navigate complex research platforms, and optimize software performance. Equally important was my ability to establish strong connections with my colleagues in the lab. Engaging in research was a profoundly enjoyable experience, one that fueled my intrinsic motivation to create something novel and valuable. This experience markedly contrasted with my prior internship in a large corporation and solidified my decision to pursue a Ph.D. program. In retrospect, it affirmed my capacity for rapid learning, my proficiency in communication, and my unwavering commitment to excel in my Ph.D. journey. I am enthusiastic about specializing in AR/VR, visual servoing, computer graphics, computer vision, and related fields, and I believe that Columbia University is the perfect institution to nurture my growth in these areas. My swift transition from a mechanical background to computer science robotics illustrates my capacity for quick adaptation. Although I didn't take classes on data structures or computer networks, my research experience substantiates my knowledge in the fundamental computer science domains. Furthermore, I haven't overlooked my mechanical knowledge, which includes expertise in control, CAD, and FEA. These skills can significantly enhance my contributions to the field of robotics. I sincerely wish Columbia could allow me to dive further into this area. I am confident that I will be successful in my Ph.D. career and provide a step forward to the community!"",""Resume"":""Haochen Wei 2001 W Cold Spring Ln, Baltimore, MD 21209 | hwei15@jhu.edu | (518) 256 3774 Education: Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland Sep 2021 - May 2023 Master of Science and Engineering in Robotics, GPA 3.80/4.00 Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY Sep 2017 - May 2021 Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering, GPA 3.73/4.00 Research Experience: Sensing, Manipulation, and Real-Time Systems (SMARTS) Lab, Johns Hopkins University Feb 2022 - Now Research Assistant, Advisor: Prof. Peter, Kazanzides Project 1: ⚫ Building an abdominal phantom with instrument tracking for laparoscopic training. ⚫ Dock the abdominal phantom with the Asynchronous Multi-Body Framework (AMBF) and visualize both the handheld instruments and dVRK console side instruments together within the AMBF, facilitating co-training with the MTM side surgeon. ⚫ Conduct a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of augmented assistance in first assistant training.

"334601415","{""SOP"":""David Kim My work experience has been driven by an interest in the intersection between computer science and medicine. My first job was at a non-profit organization disseminating specialist medical knowledge to doctors in rural areas, and I currently work at a drug discovery startup while volunteering at a medical imaging lab. While I believe there is vast room for innovation in medicine, I would like to grow my skills in computer vision, natural language processing, and data analysis in an academic setting. I have found technology typically plays second string in biotech, and therefore would like to spend the next few years becoming an expert in application, with the intent to build a future career to go back towards healthcare. My interest in research started at Georgia Tech, when I delayed graduation to develop a cognitive presence classifier on student forum data. I extracted linguistic features using both licensed and free software (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count and Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Text Cohesion) for a 90% micro recall and 82% macro recall. I found that I enjoyed working on open-ended problems. Reading papers, reviving old code to get performance with a basic random forest classifier that outperformed my classmate’s transformer model was exciting as it was an exercise of both independent problem solving and intellectual freedom. This led to volunteering at the Center for Virtual Imaging Trials lab at Duke university. Here I was tasked with developing small intestine models for virtual patients. While the project was initially proposed as an implementation of random walk algorithm, the scope naturally broadened to include developing an outer frame of a computerized tomography scan reconstruction through alpha-wrapping and conversion of the walk path into a 3D model using cubic splines. This led to my first conference submission, resulting in an oral talk at SPIE medical imaging. David Kim Finally, at my current biotech company, I volunteered to assist in publication efforts. I have trained and benchmarked internal drug discovery models against public methods. I have harmonized public and private data, run legacy libraries across old technology stacks, and replicated internal work across an electronic notebook catalog. Through this process, I have been familiarizing myself with the underpinnings of research, while working closely with doctorates. Listening to their thoughts on defining the critical path of an experiment and seeing them develop strong conclusions through meticulously designed charts has given me a desire to further improve my ability to think, communicate, and problem solve. My objective at Columbia is to develop a robust framework for inquiry and problem solving while stepping into research. Learning-wise, I would like to build a foundation in applied mathematics through coursework in the stellar mathematics department. Business-wise, I am interested in exploring opportunities in entrepreneurship through Columbia’s startup lab. Academically, I would like understand how to direct and execute research from the highly regarded faculty and explore the field of artificial intelligence with curious peers. After graduation, I would like to use my academic training to continue research in either academia or industry. I would also like to spend 1-2 years founding a startup. I believe the medical field is ripe for technological disruption, and one promising area would the medical imaging industry. The American College of Radiology reports predict a deficit in diagnostic radiologists and an increase in cancer rates. Increasing market growth, promising clinical trials, and adoption of big players like Google and Nvidia suggest the space is primed for innovation. However, I am open to exploration, as it is clear the labor market will undergo change due to integration of AI in everyday life. Large language models are now heading into abstract and higher skilled markets: law, creative writing, and software engineering. It is hard to predict David Kim where the priorities of industry, government, and society will be after graduation, but I know that I will be well prepared to adapt and thrive in any environment with Columbia’s stellar instruction."",""Resume"":""709 Audubon Lake Drive Apt P, Durham, NC, 27713 (505)-917-8245 | davidkim@gatech.edu | https://www.linkedin.com/in/davkime/ DAVID KIM EDUCATION GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY JAN 2019 - MAY 2021 Masters of Science in Computer Science, Specialization in Machine Learning GPA 4.0/4.0 Python, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SVMLight, Hadoop, Pig, Hive, Scala, Spark, Spark SQL, Spark MLlib, Spark GraphX, PyTorch, OpenCV UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO AUG 2017 - DEC 2018 Non-Degree GPA 3.89/4.3 Covered fundamental CS courses required for graduate computer science school.

"125307276","{""SOP"":""STATEMENT OF PURPOSE “I can accept failure. Everyone fails at something. But I can’t accept not trying.” I can say that this quote by Michael Jordan is the epitome of my coding endeavors and per my ideology are words to live by. During my undergraduate days, I developed a strong affinity towards mathematics which thereby strengthened even more while pursuing my Master's Degree in Financial Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology. My master's journey, however, had a tumultuous start wherein I hit rock bottom from both an academic and a personal perspective. This was mainly because the type and the level of exposure I had in mathematics and computer science during my undergraduate days was different compared to that of the rigorous master's program. A major “eye-opening” experience was when I had taken this elective called “C++ Programming in Finance” wherein it had started at a novice level but progressed geometrically in terms of difficulty thereby getting into the depths of Object Oriented Programming. My entire summarization of this course can be equated to the quote that I referenced at the start of the paragraph. I worked hard to get each of my codes to compile and run as per the assignment’s expectations and the moment that happened it was always a euphoric feeling that cannot be described in words and I have experienced that feeling only a handful number of times in my lifetime. That was when I became extremely enamored and intrigued by the power of coding and its real-world application in the field of Quantitative Finance and Algorithmic Trading and there was no looking back, ever since then. Having then decided and aspired to a career as a Quantitative/Algorithmic Trader, I decided to shape my coursework as programming intensive as possible. While certain courses such as Market Microstructure & Trading Strategies, Portfolio Theory & Applications, and Algorithmic Trading Strategies required the usage of R and Python programming languages, other courses such as Advanced Derivatives and Computational Methods in Finance mostly required the usage of Object Oriented Programming in C++. My final project had two parts to it wherein the first part was Quantifying & Increasing Diversification in Investment Portfolios by employing certain concepts such as Effective Number of Bets, Principal Component Analysis, and Minimum Linear Torsion. The second part of the project was Asset Allocation Optimization using Clustering and Deep Learning Techniques. This multi-faceted curriculum thereby SHREYAS JAIKUMAR enabled me to study, comprehend and implement a wide array of quantitative skills and programming languages which served to be extremely beneficial during the onset and on to the later stages of my professional career as a data scientist and as a data analyst as well. After having graduated from my master's program by May 2020 wherein at that time almost any sort of job aspirations (let alone ambitious and high-paying jobs) were hindered due to the worldwide bleak economic climate, as a result of COVID-19. However, I did manage to capitalize on that scenario by trading options & derivatives in the stock market and thereby pragmatically applying all the knowledge and skills that I had learned so far in graduate school. I also secured a job as a consultant in Tata Consultancy Services Limited wherein my first role was as a data scientist at JetBlue Airways Corporation and my successive role as a data analyst for an online travel agency, Priceline. Both these diverse roles required me to learn a different set of skills and thereby required the usage of various programming languages. For example, R and mainly Python were used for predictive modeling, unit testing, and data warehousing processes such as extraction, transformation, curation, and loading. SQL was used for querying to analyze and extract data from various databases like Snowflake, Oracle DB, and Google Cloud Platform. I was also responsible for the conversion of SQL to Spark SQL queries to perform the necessary executions in Databricks’ clusters and to satisfy certain framework requirements. Lastly, Tableau and Spotfire were used to visually represent the exploratory and explanatory data analysis of the EMS (Even More Space) pricing module thereby identifying pricing opportunities, demand, booking behavior, and potential outliers. Whilst pursuing my former role in JetBlue, various Machine Learning and Ensemble models were modeled by us and also a good amount of computing power and clusters were required to run the respective models. That was when I realized that I only knew what had to be done when from an application point of view and consequently, I wanted to obtain a detailed working knowledge regarding the mechanics behind the associated hardware and software used. Having been a financial engineering student and a data scientist, I have realized the significance of Artificial Intelligence in both the financial and airline industries and its potential to revolutionize the way we approach complex situations and problems. I have also come to appreciate the importance of Computer Architecture and its impact on the performance of the algorithms SHREYAS JAIKUMAR we use. This motivated me to go on a brief learning path towards AI, GPUs, SSDs, and CUDA, which further led to the reading and comprehending of various research and white papers in the field of Computer Science and Engineering along with those papers which were overlapping with that of Algorithmic Trading as well. Having obtained an Undergraduate Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I believe that advancing to a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the world-renowned Columbia University will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to further explore these areas of interest and help tackle the associated problems. Consequently, I am interested in exploring the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Architecture, especially in the context of developing efficient algorithms for large-scale and multi- dimensional data processing. The rise of Big Data has led to a need for faster and more efficient computing, and I am excited to be a part of this rapidly evolving field. I am also interested in exploring the potential of AI in optimizing hardware performance and improving power efficiency. Furthermore, I am eager to contribute to ongoing research in these areas and work towards developing practical solutions that can be implemented in real-world scenarios. I also believe that a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Columbia University will provide me with the opportunity to conduct in-depth research and collaborate with leading experts in the field, allowing me to further explore my interests and contribute to the development of cutting- edge technologies. Should I be offered an opportunity to attend Columbia University, you can rest assured that I will take advantage of the academic excellence offered by the institution and its faculty whilst contributing to meaningful dialogue during lectures and workshops. In conclusion, my academic journey so far has been a culmination of challenges, hard work, and perseverance, which has ultimately led me to my passion for programming, quantitative finance & algorithmic trading, data science, and now, artificial intelligence and computer architecture. I am confident that this prospective degree will equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to make significant contributions to the field, and I am eager to take on the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

"779314189","{""SOP"":""Statement of Purpose Kaustubh Sapru Statement of Purpose – PhD Admissions, Spring 2024 Throughout my formative years I’ve harbored a singular focus - impacting the lives of millions. I have nurtured a deep curiosity about how thing’s work, taking an interest in a range of disciplines from the restaurant business to healthcare. An underlying thread across these interests is the shared applicability of problem definition, articulation, and problem solving. Focusing on the metrics surrounding seemingly disparate areas such as customer feedback to utilizing patient data to discern trends for blood cancer treatment led me into the realm of machine learning. Having applied machine learning techniques in different environments I began developing solutions to complex problems on a larger scale. My interests lie at the intersection of statistical decision making, generative AI, computer vision, and predictive modeling. I believe a multi-faceted approach involving advances in algorithms, probabilistic inference, and human-robot interactions has enormous potential to create large scale change and impact. I am motivated to address medical negligence, an issue that has been an underlying cause of personal loss and grief. Working toward the development of an equitable, accessible, and automated early disease diagnosis system is my best shot at achieving the goal of impacting millions of lives. My journey into AI began rather unconventionally in 2016 while running a takeout business of authentic Kashmiri cuisine. Initially meant to support mine and my brother’s education, it swiftly turned into a means of representing our lost cultural heritage. In 2019, I expanded operations by utilizing data analytics coupled with machine learning to target specific demographics and identify return customers. Simultaneously, I reached out to AI engineers from universities across India and the UK, pitching ideas for an AI powered early cancer detection system, which eventually led to a partnership with a local cancer treatment startup for the underprivileged. The startup maintained a database that housed HLA data used to match patients with potential donors for bone marrow transplants. To expand the database, I worked with a team of doctors and engineers to organize stem cell donation camps across the city where I educated people on the concepts and importance of transplants. I applied my newly acquired AI skills to identify probabilities of optimal patient-donor matches. To further my understanding of AI’s broader implications, I joined the Neural Engineering Lab as a graduate data scientist in June 2021 at the City College Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI). At the Neural Engineering Lab, I found the AI community's strength lay in its openness to diverse ideas and collaborations. A pivotal relationship was fostered through mentorship from Prof. Lucas Parra, marked by daily brainstorming sessions exploring innovative concepts and strengthening my problem solving ability. I was able to enhance our team's analytical capabilities by developing a computer vision software analyzing human neural responses to facial stimuli. This addressed the larger goal of quantifying attention and engagement in humans. Widely adopted within the Parra Lab, this software supported independent research, overcoming challenges like class imbalance, improving network architecture, heightened accuracy despite scarce and uneven sampled training data, and identifying features that most accurately predict neural response. Statement of Purpose Kaustubh Sapru Since my foray into AI at City College, I have worked with leaders of financial trading companies and developers of AI powered applications. Here I had the opportunity to build upon my foundational work at CDI and I scaled my solutions. I have been inspired by the work done by Prof. Regina Barzilay at MIT, who is transforming automated early cancer detection. Her work, published in 2022 (EquiDock), raised important questions about protein flexibility for drug discovery. My most recent endeavor with Prof. Bruce Johnson, at the Advanced Science Research Center, New York, aimed at developing models that predict protein flexibility profiles using generative AI. I was able to integrate these models to NMRFx Analyst (NMR data processing software) after overcoming challenges such as saturating model accuracies, slow training times, and adding new variables to the training data. My academic training and intensive research experience has equipped me with skills such as data analysis, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, development of generative AI models, improving prediction accuracies, and data visualization. I am interested in building upon the important work of leaders in the field, including Prof. Vondrick, Prof. Zemel, Prof. Smith, Prof. Azizi, Prof. Elhadad, and Prof. Alquraishi at the Computer Science department, by devising AI models that utilize images, text, and structured data to identify trends that affect early diagnosis, treatment, and disease prevention. Computer Science at Columbia offers a unique setting where teaming up with individuals from diverse backgrounds pushes the boundaries of what is achievable. Capitalizing on industry partnerships and the interdisciplinary atmosphere, coupled with my entrepreneurial spirit, I am eager to harness my strong work ethic in pursuit of my mission: addressing the deficiencies in our current societal landscape. I bring to the table a strong sense of organization, self-motivation, and resourcefulness, along with a creative mindset that thrives in team settings. Columbia’s commitment to nurturing historically underrepresented communities fosters an environment conducive to open expression and innovation. Having witnessed firsthand the profound impact of small initiatives, whether with the kitchen or the lab, I am committed to not only pioneering groundbreaking solutions but ensuring their ethical deployment for the greater good. Yet, amidst these achievements, I've learned that true impact lies not just in the solutions we create, but in the communities we empower and the compassion we impart. As I stand at this career juncture, poised to apply past knowledge together with knowledge gained at Columbia, I'm reminded of the responsibility that accompanies expertise. It's not just about the technical advancements, but the ethical and societal implications ingrained within them. In conclusion, my journey is not solely about conquering technical challenges, but about leveraging AI as a tool for profound societal change. I am driven by a fervent desire to create solutions that innovate, empathize, and empower. This convergence of expertise and empathy, I believe, is the catalyst for true, enduring transformation. Personal Statement Kaustubh Sapru Personal Statement – PhD Admissions, Spring 2024 Entrepreneurship is the best source of community development. After running a takeaway of authentic Kashmiri cuisine for five years, connecting with various people from different backgrounds and cultures has been impactful beyond measure. Initially this venture was meant to support my and my brother’s education, however it quickly turned into a means of representing our lost language, culture, and identity. My homeland, Kashmir, had a long standing tradition of scholarship older than two millennia. A bloody genocide in the 1990s, due to terrorism in the region, not only uprooted that tradition but also displaced what was once a close knitted community and culture. With a family that was attacked and held captive by terrorists, the aftereffects of such a mass upheaval were not just economic but also emotional. Quintessentially, as resilient people, we rekindled a long lost camaraderie through connections made from our takeaway. In pursuit of providing our patrons with an authentic experience, I underwent an evolution in my personality wherein I learned my own language and the history of my homeland which originally spawned its scholarly tradition. This quest for knowledge prompted me to expand business operations by harnessing analytics over accumulated customer data to derive valuable consumer insights. Given my engineering background, I naturally gravitated towards machine learning backed data analytics. Subsequently, this fascination led me to pursue a diploma to focus on machine learning and data analytical approaches. Therein began my tryst with AI. As I began to delve into the foundations of AI, in an unfortunate turn of events, the passing of my grandfather due to medical negligence had me pondering on ‘Is there a way to predict indications of organ failure, expediting medical attention for its prevention?’. This question became the catalyst for my journey into AI driven healthcare, as I translated physiological medical records into machine readable features and applied the newly acquired fundamentals of machine learning to develop a universally applicable prediction system. To expand on the idea, I reached out to engineers and managers pitching ideas and receiving feedback that eventually led to my venture merging with a local startup also led by a fellow Kashmiri. This startup actively treated patients with blood disorders. I partnered with them to work on a remotely operated AI powered disease detection and prediction system. Owing to India’s large rural population, the patient to doctor ratio is highly skewed. It was imperative that reliable diagnosis from urban and suburban centers could reach people who did not have access to sufficient healthcare. As I progressed into the deployment stage, it became apparent that I had a long way to go before I could bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application, especially if it entailed utilizing the rapid innovations in AI. Therefore, I registered for a master’s degree in biomedical engineering with a focus on data science at City College New York. Since my journey into AI at City College, I have worked with leaders of financial trading companies and developers of AI powered applications, allowing exposure to the intricacies of articulating problems followed by testing and automating solutions, and then scaling them. My most recent development with Prof. Bruce Johnson at the Advanced Science Research Center was a model predicting protein movement profiles using GANs based on experimental NMR data. Additionally, I designed a multi-cascaded architecture of FNet Auto-Encoders, Time to Vector Transformers, and Residual ConvNets trained on multi-channel time series NMR data to predict properties of sparsely populated protein conformations crucial to drug discovery. Having integrated both models with the NMRFx Analyst, a software that primarily processes experimental data, I honed Personal Statement Kaustubh Sapru my skills to include data analysis, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, development of machine learning/deep learning models, data manipulation and visualization. With these skills, I believe I can make constructive contributions to machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, NLP or the computational biology groups at the Computer Science department at Columbia. One of the defining strengths of the AI community is its openness to diverse ideas and collaboration opportunities. One of the pivotal relationships that quickly propelled me towards becoming a proficient problem solver was the mentorship I received from my supervisor, Prof. Lucas Parra. Our interactions were marked by day to day brainstorming sessions, during which we consistently explored innovative concepts. Through these collaborative efforts, I enhanced the analytical capabilities of my research team by creating a computer vision software program designed to analyze the neural response of human subjects exposed to facial stimuli. This addressed the larger goal of quantifying attention and engagement in humans. My contribution ultimately culminated in the publication of our findings in Nature Communications and my thesis has had increasing viewership around the globe ever since. This accomplishment was further acknowledged and celebrated by both the Biomedical Engineering department and my advisor, who honored me with multiple prestigious awards for my dedicated work. With a comprehensive background in biomedical engineering, which encompasses intensive research experience and a solid three-year tenure as a professional data scientist, I find myself well-positioned to explore the intricacies of computer science at a deeper level. This endeavor promises to provide my ideas with a more substantial foundation, enhancing their potential for impactful outcomes. Nestled in the vibrant city of New York, Columbia University offers a unique setting where collaboration with individuals from diverse backgrounds pushes the boundaries of what is achievable. Capitalizing on industry partnerships and the interdisciplinary atmosphere, coupled with my entrepreneurial spirit, I aspire to make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions, which constitutes my ultimate goal. I bring to the table a strong sense of organization, self-motivation, and resourcefulness, along with a creative mindset that thrives in team settings. My ability to identify problems and collaborate with teams to propose efficient solutions is a testament to my skill set. In addition to my formal education and professional experience, I have also demonstrated my commitment to becoming a proficient code developer through multiple online courses and successful completion of various coding tests. Since my initial encounter with artificial intelligence, I have diligently pursued every opportunity to expand my knowledge, and my enthusiasm for continued growth in this cutting-edge domain intensifies with each passing day. My interactions with researchers, including instructors and fellow students at Columbia University, have deepened my appreciation for Columbia’s commitment to diversity and inclusion. I firmly believe that this dedication to historically underrepresented communities will afford me the freedom to express my ideas openly, brainstorm innovative solutions, and bring them to fruition. Having witnessed firsthand the profound impact even small initiatives can make, I am eager to harness my strong work ethic in pursuit of my mission: addressing the deficiencies in our current societal landscape to benefit the broader population. Consequently, I am at a juncture in my career where I am prepared to take the next significant stride and effectively apply the knowledge I acquire at Columbia University to positively shape our ever-evolving society."",""Resume"":""KAUSTUBH SAPRU 646 417 4838|kaustubh.sapru@gmail.com|github.com/KaustubhSapru92|LinkedIn CAREERHIGHLIGHTS AI Researcher with 3 years of experience in writing production-ready code to develop, deploy and scale AI/ML systems.

"976927815","{""SOP"":""HariSanthanam My first exposure to a major research environment was in my junior year at Princeton University,whenI conducted researchinProfessor NirajJha’slab. Iwas taskedwithdetermining if a sparse ResNet-50 architecture could achieve similar levels of accuracy as a dense architecture when trained on a small retinal dataset of OCT scans. Through many binary classification experiments, between the healthy class and each retinal disease class, and multiclass classification experiments, I discovered that therewasan averagediscrepancyof only 0.5% in performance between the dense and sparse architectures. It was a great learning experience, as I discovered the intricacies of transferlearning andPyTorchmodel training. Most of all, I found within mea desiretoengage inresearch anddiscovernewknowledge. Ihave since become further fascinated by topics in computer vision, machine learning, and image analysis, through rewarding research opportunities as a B.S.E. student at Princeton and as an M.S.E. studentatUPenn. During my senior year at Princeton University, I completed my Undergraduate Senior Thesis under the guidance of Professor Niraj Jha. In my first foray into computer vision, I focused on applying an image synthesis technique called DeepInversion to an instance segmentation network, reducingthe needfor labeledvideo data infutureapplications.Todothis, I inverted a fixed Mask R-CNN architecture, from random noise, with additional image and feature distribution regularization terms to generate input frames fromthe DAVISdataset. Since this was the first application of DeepInversion to an instance segmentation network, I faced several development challenges in model design and TensorFlow implementation that required me to pose novel questions and form creative solutions. After months ofexperimentation, I was happy to finally synthesize DAVIS video frames and have my work featured by the Princeton HariSanthanam Statistics and Machine Learning Center. Through this research project, I understood the importance of persevering through challengesand appreciatingtherewarding, yetdifficult nature of research. In my first year as a Robotics Master’s student at UPenn, I pursued a newfound interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Under the mentorship of Professor Lyle Ungar, I worked with doctors from the University of Utah on a Pediatric Sepsis study, presented in the form of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. While XAI methods do exist to understand and analyze models trainedon EHRdata, ourcasestudy presentedmany casesof featurecollinearity, which XAI models work poorly on. As a result, I used Shapley values to illustrate the need for feature set creation and feature adjustments to remove collinearity and enhance model explainability. During this interdisciplinary endeavor, I was fortunate to be able to work with doctors, so I could gain agreaterunderstanding of themedical andbiologicaldrivers behind ML predictions. I am excited that these findings could contribute to the current XAIliterature inthe medical domain. This project provided me with a meaningful lens to explore the remarkable interplay between machine learning and healthcare, and showed me that scientific research can be usedinservice of others. In my second year atUPenn, Icompleted aMaster’sThesis inProfessorJianbo Shi’s lab, focused on computer vision research. Motivated by applications that need adaptable 3D shape models, usually with little training data, I automatically generated a contour labeled dataset that contains crucial information for basic 3D object understanding. With this novel dataset, I explored the performance of instance segmentation architectures on detecting and labeling the HariSanthanam contours, and additionally demonstrated a surprising improvement in 3D reconstruction from a 2D image. Not only did my work culminate in a co-first author publication in the Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV 2023), but it also gave me the opportunity to engage in discussions with researchers in industry and academia, and share my work with faculty in the field through thesisandconference presentations.From theseformative experiences, I have learned how to confidently communicate my research, think creatively and independently,andform strong relationshipsin aresearchcommunity. I have expanded my interests in machine learning and computer vision through industry research as well. As anAdvancedR&D Internat AmazonRobotics, Igenerated syntheticdata to improve the segmentation performance onanewwarehousesensorsetting. Tothisend, Ilearned transformations, using GANs, that realistically placed labeled foreground objects from a pre-existing sensor setting into the new setting. After a gratifying internship at Amazon, I am now working at Agility Robotics, where I develop perception models for human-centric robots. With these experiences, I have developed the ability to solve challenging, open-ended research problemsthat haverealworld applications. My past research and academic experiences motivate me to continue work in machine learning and computer vision, specifically for biomedical imaging analysis. For this reason, I have a strong interest to work with Professor Despina Kontos and contribute to her groundbreaking work in this field. I am especially excited by her research in the use of AI and machine learning for understanding and diagnosing cancer. I have read with great interest her work onDeep-LIBRA,whichuses CNNs,superpixel generation, andradiomic machinelearning, HariSanthanam to achieve an impressive AUC for breast density estimation on a multi-racial, multi-hospital dataset. Also, I am very interested in her work on identifying intrinsic phenotypes for breast cancer risk, using traditional machine learning techniques. More generally, I am drawn to work with Professor Kontos because of her use of imaging for enhanced disease diagnosis and non-invasive medical care. I believe my research experiences inmachine learningandcomputer vision, and my strong interest in biomedical imaging analysis, allow me to be a great fit for ProfessorKontos’ lab. I hope to join Columbia’s Ph.D. program and engage in collaborative work with researchers in the Vagelos College of Physiciansand Surgeons,anddevelop biomedical imaging models that benefit society. I am especially excited by the possibility of working with leading biomedical researchersinthe worldand contributingto theinterdisciplinary researchinthe BME department, by drawing from my background in electrical engineering, robotics, and computer science. I am also delighted to learnthat theprogram emphasizesteachingexperiencesfor Ph.D. students. One of my more memorable experiences as a Master’s student at UPenn was working as a teaching assistant for a graduate level computer vision course.Asa Ph.DstudentinBME, I look forward to forging more experiences as a teaching assistant and tutoring students from diverse backgrounds. In the future, I would like to lead an academic research lab, founded on innovation, collaboration, and service, and pioneer groundbreaking work in vision and ML for biomedical imaging applications. I look forwardtoembarking onthis journey,through the Ph.D. program atColumbiaUniversity."",""Resume"":""Hari Santhanam 484-340-9848 | santhanam.hari@gmail.com | santhanamhari.github.io | santhanamhari | hsanthanam Education UniversityofPennsylvania Philadelphia,PA M.S.E.iNROBOTiCS,GPA:4.00 Sep2020‑May2022 SPECiALiZATiONiNCOMPUTERViSiON PrincetonUniversity Princeton,NJ B.S.E.WiTHHONORSiNELECTRiCALENGiNEERiNG,GPA:3.64,DEPARTMENTALGPA:3.85 Sep2016‑Jun2020 CERTiFiCATESiNSTATiSTiCSANDMACHiNELEARNiNG,ROBOTiCSANDINTELLiGENTSYSTEMS Coursework AdvancedTopicsinMachinePerception,ComputerVision&ComputationalPhotography,DeepLearning,MachineLearning,LinearAlgebra&Opti‑ mization,LinearSystemsTheory,DigitalSignalProcessing,BuildingRealSystems,Probability&StochasticSystems,Algorithms&DataStructures Skills Programming: Python,Java,C,C++,Matlab,R,Verilog Frameworks: PyTorch,Tensorflow,OpenCV,Numpy,Keras WorkExperience AgilityRobotics Tangent,OR OBJECTDETECTiONANDTRACKiNGPERCEPTiONENGiNEER Sep2022‑present • Creatinganddeployingdataaugmentationtechniquestoenhancetheobjectdetectionandtrackingsystemonhuman‑centricrobotDigit.

"134186870","{""SOP"":""In my opinion, the most important thing anyone can achieve in their life is a sense of purpose. While it varies from person to person, for me, it is clearly relevant in the field of science and technology, more specifically in the field of mechanics; improving the lives of common people through technical development. So I would like to pursue a doctoral degree in engineering mechanics from Columbia University. I am currently obtaining a master’s degree in computational engineering at Leibniz Universität Hannover and I have faith in the quote said by the greatest scientist Albert Einstein:“ Tell me and I forget; teach me and I may remember; involve me and I learn.” This quote inspires and motivates me to engage in research in the field of mechanics, through which I am able to expand my knowledge and also contribute to it. I was born and raised in a small town in eastern India. I consider myself fortunate because I was raised in a culture where knowledge is more valued than money. Thus, pursuing knowledge by achieving a higher degree is very common in our society. I have completed my bachelor's from Jadavpur University, one of the most prestigious universities in my country, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and during this period of my education I have realized that knowledge is boundless and whatever you have thrived is never enough; one must continuously learn and refine his or her skill to make a difference someday. Since my second year of bachelor's, I have involved myself in research work, which marks the beginning of my learning. I have started to develop skills that are needed in the field of mechanics, through which I was able to publish several research journals during my bachelor's, contributing to the mechanical society. Yet, after successfully completing my bachelor’s degree, when I was offered a job at Reliance Industries Ltd. in Jamnagar Complex, the largest refinery in the world and a notable global brand, I was very keen to join. The reason being, the job profile I got is among the best in the industry, as Reliance has a wide range of machinery with some advanced technologies and exposure to such an industrial environment provides me with a better understanding of the growing technologies and their demand. I was ready to explore the opportunity, as I always crave new experiences and challenges. Even with my bachelor's degree and first-hand experience in an industry, I never felt like an expert and had the eagerness to learn more. To widen my expertise, I started my master's at Leibniz Universität Hannover, one of the TU9 of Germany, in the field of computational mechanics. Through my master's courses, I was introduced to several new concepts in the field of mechanics such as advanced FEM analysis, stochastic analysis, uncertainty quantification, model order reduction, ML in mechanics and several others. Similar to my bachelor's approach, I have started working in parallel with my course work as a research student in the IBNM department of the university. Through this opportunity, I have developed technical skills to solve coupled equations in FEM, while simultaneously contributing to open source communities on GitHub such as FEnics and RBnics. Soon I was offered a project at Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH to develop a framework to produce Hexahedral meshing for their tire tread patterns. To add to my achievement, the framework developed can produce hex-mesh automatically, through which the simulation time and accuracy have significantly increased, which adds to savings in computational time and cost. Physics and mathematics are the subjects where I have always found my interest, especially the concepts of Newtonian mechanics. During my schooling, I extensively studied it out of interest and even participated in school exhibitions, building some real small machinery stuff, and thus I was a person whom my peers contacted when they needed some discussion or to clear any doubts on this topic. Throughout my life, I have always tried to be in the good books of people, which has eventually helped me. Through sheer motivation and not-easily-giving-up skill, professors in my universities have given me immense support and motivation to pursue a doctoral degree in the field of mechanics. Through my professors, I have been in contact with Prof. Haim Waisman at Columbia University. I have found the work of Prof. Waisman team very fascinating, and the work on the topics of material topological advancement and phase-field interactions has enthralled me. I have always been engulfed in innovative work and have gained good knowledge in the field of mechanics through my learning and work experiences. I am proficient in several programming languages, such as MATLAB, Python, and C++. Likewise, I have developed my coding skills not because of coursework or coding materials but through my involvement in writing codes for the research topics I have been working on. I am also well-equipped with various simulation and modeling software packages like AutoCAD, ANSYS and SolidWorks. Several of my research projects required simulating and modeling tasks, and I have become quite handy with a lot of software packages and am open to exploring new ones as well. One thing I have realized during my work is that these commercial software packages are very costly to use and many researchers lack the funds to use them and proceed with their work. So in order to motivate people to contribute more to research, I have always favored the use of open source software like Julia, OpenFoam, FEnics, Gmsh and several others. In this way, one significantly decreases the cost involved in a project, and for the development of these open source software packages, I have contributed to it too through some tutorials in their GitHub community. It is one of my strongest desires to make these open- source environments capable enough to solve all kinds of complex problems, which will motivate a huge research group to pursue their work further. This urge for research can be traced back to my childhood. As a curious child, I was a voracious reader of science magazines and always tried to build some small stuff, which pleases me. Reading books has significantly enhanced my imagination capability, and enacting those knowledge is something I believe is one of my greatest strengths. In addition to the above, I consider creativity an important aspect of my character. From childhood, I never wanted to follow the masses. For me, one of my biggest achievements in life was when, in 12th standard, I was the zonal topper in physics out of around 8,000 candidates in the FTRE organized by FIITJEE and also when I, along with one of my academic professor, published my first research paper. I was even selected for the INAE scholarship for my summer internship, which chooses only 50 students throughout the country. The joy felt after having the first positive results from the work was immense. But I found similar satisfaction and pride when I made my first piece of music with lyrics, or wrote my first poem for my school magazine. Maintaining my eagerness to learn and explore the field of mechanics while strengthening my skills and expertise, I want to pursue a doctoral degree in this field. Columbia University, part of the Ivy League, has an extravagant reputation as a university throughout the world. Pursuing my doctoral degree at this university will have a very great impact on my career and work. The research at this university from the engineering mechanics department has fascinated me and I am eager to join the department to learn from them and work with them. Through my several meetings with Prof. Waisman in engineering mechanics, I have been allured by the work of his team. I want to join Prof. Waisman team and work on his project topics related to XFEM and material topology. Under his leadership and guidance, I can learn and see myself grow, expanding my expertise and contributing to the field of computational mechanics. Postgraduation from Columbia University will boost my profile and knowledge exponentially and it will help me grasp greater opportunities in the near future."",""Resume"":""EXPERIENCE GOP AL 10/2022 – ongoing – RDBT/VD-CVT/TTM, Continental Reifen Deutschland GmbH, Hannover AGA RWAL Master Thesis (10/22-03/23), Supervisor: Dr. Ing.

"765161652","{""SOP"":""Isaac Olatunji PERSONAL STATEMENT I was the first on call in the Maxillofacial department during my National Youth Service year when I was invited to attend to a 19-year-old male patient who presented with a rapidly growing, severely painful, ulcerated facial swelling that had extended from left to right side of his lower face and neck. As I had to refer him to a more equipped hospital for a comprehensive management, the boy’s father asked me in their native language “Doctor, are you sure everything will return to normal once we get there?”. Of course, I couldn’t give a definitive answer even though I knew the most likely outcome, from putting one and two together. How cool would it have been if I could write a prescription on the spot and reassure them? After completing my first degree in Dental Surgery in Nigeria, I already knew I would have a research career. From my experiences, and observations during my clinical years as a student, I had become more curious about the presentations, and course of some conditions beyond the scope of clinical practice, particularly cancer. Rather atypical of a pure clinician’s training, I began to dig more into the molecular basis for cancer, and I did find interesting revelations in the literature. However, with more knowledge came more questions. In summary, this led to the publication of my article titled “Potential Application of Tumor Suppressor MicroRNAs for Targeted Therapy in Head and Neck Cancer”. Along the way, I found it cool the idea of creating something from the scratch, and building it based on one’s specifications. In short, I taught myself how to program! The combination of these knowledge, and other skills from various sources have all culminated in my research interests, and current work. In our recently published work, which was part of my masters thesis, we explored the use of multimodal data- genomic, clinical, and histopathology images for the prediction of Distant Metastasis (DM) in carcinoma patients. In this work, we applied an optimization technique with Isaac Olatunji the random forest algorithm for identification of gene expression biomarkers in distant metastasis samples, and also investigated whether similarities exist between metastatic genes in the three different types of cancer studied. The genes selected by our method performed better than differentially expressed genes that were selected using the DESeq2 software. Also, our results confirmed that no single specific gene can certify the presence or absence of DM, rather DM is influenced by various combination of genes which are different in each cancer type. To predict DM directly from histopathology images, we tested the DenseNet121 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture as well as KimiaNet, a DenseNet121 architecture model pretrained on ImageNet data and finetuned on about 250000 domain histopathology images. KimiaNet did not provide a tangible advantage over DenseNet121 in the task of prediction of DM from histopathology images. Overall, combining genomic, image, and clinical data for prediction of DM gave better results, however genomic data provided the highest contribution. Beside my thesis work I have also been actively involved in multiple group and individual projects, some of which are listed on my resume. I am passionate about application of AI in precision medicine, and drug discovery. Going through the list of faculty members, I am fascinated by the research of Dr. Mohammed AlQuraishi, Dr. Elham Azizi, and Dr. David Knowles. I believe my past experiences have prepared me well for this position. I possess a combination of computational and statistical skills, strong knowledge of molecular biology, as well as clinical patient management experience. This means I can identify research gaps, design research with consideration of its final clinical applications, and with my technical skills carry out the research. I am certain that the PhD Computer Science program at Columbia University will be just perfect Isaac Olatunji to merge my skills, and experiences as I look forward to creating better healthcare solutions. Perhaps in future, a 19-year-old’s life will be saved by writing a prescription."",""Resume"":""ISAAC TOLULOPE OLATUNJI 🞂 27, River Meadow Drive, Rochester, NY 14623 Phone: +1(585-303-3673) E-mail: iospring24@gmail.com EDUCATION ● Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, USA, 2021 – 2023 o Master of Science in Bioinformatics ● College of Medicine of the University of Lagos (CMUL), Lagos, Nigeria, 2009-2016. o Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) PUBLICATION(S) AND PROJECT(S) ● Olatunji I and Cui F (2023) Multimodal AI for prediction of distant metastasis in carcinoma patients.

"085892373","{""SOP"":""MaheshGaneshBhat It seemed like magic when I got my first video gaming console: an array of objects working together to provide a new experience made possible by something. I realised the science of that magic when I started understanding the world of electricals, electronics, and integrated circuits. The idea of a bunch of tiny devices being able to contain so much data and perform so many functions attracted me towards electronics. My strong academic foundation during my Pre-University studies facilitated my pursuit of an undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering at The National Institute of Engineering. Participation in Robotics workshops and implementation of microcontroller-based projects, such as obstacle-avoiding bots, line-following bots, and DTMF-Controlled bots, piqued my interest in Microcontrollers, Control Systems, and Embedded Systems. This led me to undertake projects based on Arduino during my undergraduate studies, including the development of a Resistive Touchscreen-based Smart Wheelchair for the differently-abled. This project motivated me to delve deeper into microcontroller architecture. For my graduation team project, I designed a Visible Light Communication system using the System-on-Chip RaspberryPi for medium bit-rate data transmission of files. The system achieved speeds of a few Megabits per second and successfully transmitted data of up to 6 kilobytes with minimal errors. My fascination with the realm of technology has motivated me to further my education and pursue a graduate degree. After evaluating various academic institutions, I elected to enrol in the Communications Engineering master's program at the prestigious Technical University of Munich. Despite its nomenclature, the program is a culmination of diverse courses and electives that encompass a range of subjects relevant to communication technology, including hardware, software, and mathematical concepts. Based on my prior interests and current knowledge, I have identified two streams that are of particular interest to me: Embedded Systems and Security, and Data Networks and the Internet of Things (IoT). The German higher education system offers a valuable opportunity for students to gain practical experience in research through a structured course format that includes a research internship and a master's thesis. In this regard, I was fortunate to secure a research internship at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied and Integrated Security (AISEC), where I worked for three months on integrating Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) into the institute's secure virtualisation solution. During my time at the institute, I gained hands-on experience with the Yocto-based Linux distribution and acquired fundamental knowledge of operating system development. Building on my prior student project experiences, I was able to secure a research opportunity for my master's thesis at Huawei Munich Research Center, a leading industry player in telecommunications and data networks. During my time at Huawei, I conducted an investigation and comparison of Network Management Protocols for Industrial Networks. This involved the development of prototype implementations of complete RESTCONF and the newly proposed CORECONF stack in C, using standard GNU libraries. The performance of these protocols was then compared against the currently used NETCONF, with respect to key parameters. The test network was emulated MaheshGaneshBhat using a combination of mininet in docker virtualisation. This experience provided me with valuable technological and personal skill improvement and practical research skills related to literature survey, timeline and milestone determination, and documentation. The research has been submitted to the IEEE IoT Journal and is under review. These experiences have prepared me for the extensive effort required in successfully pursuing and completing a Doctoral research degree. I am a diligent and disciplined student who likes to keep simple goals and keep expanding along with newer add-ons. Being a part of various co-curricular student bodies like the quiz club and the Innovation and Multimedia committee, I have paid utmost attention to balancing academics and extra-curricular tasks, constantly trying to expand my knowledge of the core basic subjects of electronics. This is an important reason for me to take up this course to enhance my learning. I believe that with these experiences working on relatively niche concepts with little to no prior headstart, I have gained devotion towards dedicated research work to satiate my curiosity which might be a good fit for a doctoral research candidate. Columbia University is a highly esteemed academic institution renowned for its significant research contributions. The Department of Electrical Engineering covers a plethora of domains that intrigue me, given my interest and prior research experience in the Internet of Things (IoT). In particular, the research interests of Dr. Zoran Kostić seem very interesting and appealing given my affection towards the areas of Industrial IoT, Security and Embedded Systems and I would be glad to get an opportunity to work under his tutelage. I am eager to pursue my academic aspirations at Columbia University and contribute to the institution's legacy of excellence in research and education. The pursuit of a doctoral degree is of great interest to me as it would allow me to delve deeply into and broaden my understanding of the fundamental components that make daily living possible. Upon completion of the program, my primary objective is to join an organization and generate original ideas that satisfy people's curiosity. As a model student, I would enhance the reputation of the university. The academic knowledge and practical experience gained through the PhD program would enable me to add value to the esteemed institution. After a thorough examination of the available courses, I am confident that I will be guided towards a distinguished career path. In a nutshell, I yearn to be a part of the Ph.D. program at Columbia University. Being part of the elite and revered institute would be an honour. I look forward to having a great learning experience, and I greatly appreciate your consideration of my application. Thank you in advance for considering my application."",""Resume"":""Mahesh Ganesh Bhat Experience Details Master Thesis , Huawei Munich Research Center, Munich MAY 2022 — APRIL 2023 55, 1st Cross, Bhuvaneshwari Nagar, Title: Investigation and Comparison of Network Management Protocols Bangalore, 560057, India for Industrial Networks Phone: +91 9035732962 Email: mahesh81196@gmail.com ● Grade - 1.3 ● Develop prototype implementation of complete RESTCONF and CORECONF stack in C using standard GNU libraries Skills ● A comparative study of configuration management protocols in C Programming Industry 4.0, namely NETCONF, RESTCONF, and CORECONF C++ Programming Work Student, Huawei Munich Research Center, Munich Python NOVEMBER 2021 — APRIL 2022 ● Integrated the existing Docker-based proxy solution for a Time- A ssembly Language Sensitive Networking switch for device management demo setup VHDL Work Student, Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich Linux FEBRUARY 2021 — MARCH 2021 Embedded Systems ● Investigate the integration of Fraunhofer's Trustme Distro onto NVIDIA Jetson boards Embedded C Intern, Fraunhofer AISEC, Munich Contiki-NG OS for IoT NOVEMBER 2020 — JANUARY 2021 Cryptography ● Integration of CUDA modules into a custom yocto-based Linux kernel Keras ● Created containerized solution for CUDA applications with relevant Docker access rights for memory isolation Yocto Work Student: Junior Embedded Systems Engineer, Motius GmbH, Munich S ecurity for Embedded Security OCTOBER 2019 — FEBRUARY 2020 Time-Sensitive Networking Worked on different protocols for inter-vehicle communication ● Implemented modules for MQTT, AMQP, and DDS Languages ● Developed an integrated test suite based on the use cases English Education Kannada Master of Science in Communications Engineering, The Technical Hindi University of Munich, Munich Tamil OCTOBER 2018 — JUNE 2023 ● Subjects: Embedded systems and Security, Project lab Secure SoC Telugu for IoT (AES-GCM), Physical Unclonable Functions, Advanced Cryptographic Implementation, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Secure Communication, Project Praktikum Smart Card Hobbies Lab Playing Chess, Reading Books ● Seminar: A Study of Different Horizontal and Single Trace Side- Channel Attacks on Post-Quantum Cryptographic Algorithms Links Linkedin Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communications, The National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru AUGUST 2014 — JUNE 2018 CGPA - 9/10 ● Seminar: Event-Triggered Model Predictive Analysis for Artificial Pancreas Control ● Class A - Variable Modulation Index AM Generator Projects Undergraduate project - HERMES, Mysuru OCTOBER 2017 — MAY 2018 The current model in design is aimed to enable faster data transmission compared to the existing models by making use of visible light spectrum and various data encoding methods.

"159558714","{""SOP"":""Vanessa YiRan Li I fondly remember my efforts to recreate the lung-on-a-chip platform in the open hallways of my high school. The day prior, I had scraped the surface of pig lungs bought from the wet market and seeded them into growth media I had read about in literature. To my disappointment, the cell media had turned yellow from overheating and was swarmed with bacteria. Though disheartened at the time, I cherish these moments of “failure” as I conduct experiments in the laboratory today. The opportunity to ask questions, to fail, and to grow as well as to occasionally find something life-changing captivates me. I am not only enthralled to discover more but also determined to utilize these steps of scientific inquiry as my toolbox to advance healthcare. As such, I am determined to pursue a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University to become a research scientist — with the goal of driving sustainable change in the world around me. As a first-year undergraduate student, I jumped at the opportunity to join the Weiss Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where I worked alongside a team of aspiring scientists to form cell swarms and properly learned to culture mammalian cells. Specifically, I genetically engineered human embryonic cells to release chemokine and characterized the movement of neutrophils toward these cells using transwell assays and fluorescent microscopy. I then moved from genetics to organs, working in the Zhang lab at Harvard Medical School to fabricate glomerulus-on-a-chip platforms with light-activated hydrogels and 3D bioprinters. The ability to engineer different pieces of the human body fascinates me as it redefines our definition of biology. It transforms today’s medicine, which is based on drugs, into personalized cell-based therapies developed using the building blocks of the human body. As such, I want to be a part of this extraordinary shift in biomedicine to tackle urgent health challenges in the 21st century. Vanessa YiRan Li Amidst the crisis of COVID and the sudden pause to my research at the Zhang Lab, I was given the opportunity to spend more time with my extended family in Japan, specifically my uncle. I watched him struggle physically and financially with unexpected episodes of heart attacks. As such, I started reading into heart diseases and clinical trials to become better informed on the procedures and treatments he endured. As I delved deeper into literature, my interest in the heart grew more and more not only because of its significance as a modulator of the entire human body but also its symbolism as a bridge that connects people. My interest led to an opportunity at the Yoshida Lab at Kyoto University’s Center for iPS Research and Application where I engineered heart organoids to study the effect of MAPK inhibitors and immunosuppressants on cardiac fibrosis. In the process, I was able to build upon skills I have previously used as well as learn new techniques, such as immunostaining and polymerase chain reaction, that I have come to use in my day-to-day life as a research assistant today. When I joined Columbia in 2022, I continued my exploration of the heart and its diseases at Professor Vunjak-Novakovic’s Laboratory For Stem Cells and Tissue Engineering. During my first two semesters, I conducted mitochondrial assays and analyzed surface proteins to contribute to an existing project exploring myocardial injury in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Through this study, I was able to gain experience differentiating iPSC cells into cardiomyocytes and constructing bioreactors using PDMS, which I then combined to form 3D engineered cardiac tissues. Currently, I am pursuing my independent project embedding gold nanorods into engineered cardiac tissues with the hopes of stimulating electrical maturation in a way that more closely resembles the human myocardium. Through these studies, I have grown tremendously as a scientist with the incredible mentorship I have received and have learned to find joy in not only Vanessa YiRan Li the successful experiments but also the failures in between. Furthermore, I sincerely appreciate the sense of community in the lab from eating Serbian food in the East Village, building Christmas trees out of lab gloves, to summer picnics at Central Park. Being a part of this team has reaffirmed my interest in scientific research and most of all, the strong presence of female leadership has inspired me to set ambitious goals for myself. As a Ph.D. student, I intend to continue the research I have started and to make use of the skillset I have garnered to ask deeper scientific questions. Under the guidance of Professor Vunjak-Novakovic and Professor Cheng, I plan on studying the role of exosomes in cardioprotection using heart-on-a-chip platforms. I am curious about the pathogenic function of exosomes released upon diseases and injury, like ischemia-reperfusion injury, and their trafficking between different cell types within the heart. Furthermore, how do factors such as age, sex, and race affect EV content? Can exosomes be used for personalized diagnostic markers and therapeutic approaches in cardiovascular diseases? The emerging role of exosomes has the potential to unveil unknown mechanisms and new therapies and is currently being explored in Professor Cheng’s lab. Professor Vunjak-Novakovic’s lab offers a heart-on-a-chip platform to model and study cardiovascular diseases in vitro. As such, this collaborative effort combines the strength of both labs to explore unventured avenues in biomedicine and I am honored to be able to be a part of and take the lead on this project. In parallel to my research interests, I have always been passionate about the intersection of medicine, sociology, and advocacy. My upbringing in China, Japan, and the United States informed me of the immense privilege of having a voice in who I want to be knowing that this is not a global norm. As such, I seek for opportunities to advocate for equity in and out of the Vanessa YiRan Li laboratory. At Columbia, this has manifested in the form of being a student advocate as an ambassador for the BME department and the inter-school chair of the Engineering Graduate Student Council. I have organized events to foster interdisciplinary conversations on next- generation issues and offered support to students, especially those who are underrepresented in higher education, to find their place at Columbia Engineering. As a Ph.D. student, I hope to continue my advocacy efforts for the student body by stepping into leadership positions and taking an active role in community events. I intend to make a positive impact through both my lab work and community engagement efforts, working towards the goal of becoming a research scientist who will make a difference. Upon completing my Ph.D., I plan on engaging in a career in research to redefine what is possible in cardiovascular care and to advocate for equity in healthcare. I can envision myself developing personalized tissue models that reflect sex differences in diseases or fighting for the safe use of new biotechnology such as stem cell therapy. Along the way, I intend to use my compassion, curiosity, and leadership skills to make a real impact on the world. At Columbia, I am excited to be in a space that curates the perfect environment for me to thrive, and am even more elated to have found my community within this space. As I continue to pursue research, I wish to encounter more moments of growth from using brightfield microscopy to find lung cells to operating high throughput imagers to characterize cardiac tissues. I look forward to encountering more moments of “failures” I can look back and laugh at in the future as I bring scientific research closer to the world."",""Resume"":""Vanessa YiRan Li yl5200@columbia.edu | +1 (339) 213-0689 | vanessaliyiran.webflow.io | New York City, NY Education Columbia University, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences Expected Dec 2023 M.S. in Biomedical Engineering | GPA 4.21/4.00 New York, NY • Concentration in Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering Wellesley College May 2022 B.A in Chemistry (Honors) and Sociology | GPA 3.92/4.00 Wellesley, MA • Durant Scholars Summa Cum Laude and Sigma Xi Scientific Research Honor Society Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) May 2022 Gordon-MIT Certificate in Engineering Leadership |GPA: 5.00/5.00 Cambridge, MA Research Experience Translational Therapeutics Accelerator (B.

"504448712","{""SOP"":""Personal Statement Yue Jiao During my childhood, I experienced an assault that left me blind for several months. Remarkably, despite my pupils losing function, medical treatments gradually restored my vision to normal. During moments of fatigue over the years, I draw strength from the vivid memory of that pivotal morning when I sensed faint light filtering through layers of gauze and dried blood. These moments empower me to find hope after setbacks. This early trauma also ignited a profound curiosity and fascination for the potential of medicine. As I matured, I recognized that this event was not just a miracle but the result of the tireless efforts of countless scientists over many years. My goal is to extend this \""miracle\"" and offer hope to others, utilizing my skills and passions to create a positive impact. I firmly believe that my passion and determination will serve as enduring motivators in this field. After years of studying biochemistry and engineering, I've come to understand the extensive research required to realize my aspirations. Hence, I am eager to advance my education by pursuing a Ph.D. at Columbia University. My academic journey at Columbia University and the University of California, Irvine, has provided a robust foundation in chemical biology and computational chemistry. During my undergraduate years, as public concern regarding COVID-19 peaked, I felt compelled to delve deeper into the subject. In the fall of 2021, I conducted intensive research on the 'Effects of the Inhibitor Molnupiravir on Viral RNA Polymerase and the Regulation of RNA Synthesis Fidelity in SARS-COV-2'. To achieve this, I employed molecular dynamics simulations and modeling tools such as ATOM, Avogadro, Xquartz, and VMD to identify altered protein positions on the virus following polymerase inhibitor attachment. I focused on Molnupiravir, a potential COVID-19 drug classified as a polymerase inhibitor. This journey, particularly in the field of 3D molecular dynamic simulations and code functionalities, led me to uncover previously undiscovered structural changes upon activation. Through partial charge calculations, I identified four mutated protein positions. This discovery, combined with successful molecule simulations, significantly enhanced my programming skills for intricate data calculations and refined my analytical expertise in biochemical polymer simulations. This computational and modeling prowess is crucial for advancing biomaterial and drug design simulations and tailoring materials to specific therapeutic requirements. During my undergraduate studies, my research on covid polymerase inhibitors was primarily computer-oriented. I would like to gain a deeper understanding of the entire research process in the wet lab. Therefore, at Columbia University, I became part of the COVID-19 Therapeutic Development project under the guidance of Professor Jingyu Ju in his lab. I've been immersed in and focused on inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 exonuclease polymerase using ombitasvir which is another strong potential antiviral drug for covid virus. Specifically, my role centered on doing chemistry synthesis of analogs of ombitasvir and testing their efficiency, with a keen emphasis on exploring exonuclease inhibitors. My responsibilities spanned from setting up enzymatic assays and purifying RNA to employing MALDI for analysis. A particularly enriching aspect of this experience was my involvement in enzyme kinetic calculations, allowing me to discern the type of enzyme inhibition and pinpoint how to find the target insert position pivotal for drug stimulation. Additionally, I broadened my expertise by venturing into organic chemical synthesis. This hands- on experience underscored the intricate relationship between molecular biology, organic chemistry, and pharmacology. This period equipped me with expertise in chemical synthesis of drugs, biological testing, and biomedical assay, positioning me well for tasks related to drug discovery and biomaterial design. Under Professor Jingyue Ju and the group’s guidance, I was engaged in the pharmaceutical field, accelerating my pursuit of advanced biomaterials and medicine. Ultimately, I believe that as a chemical engineer, it's essential to understand the entire journey of a product from its inception in the industry to its introduction to the market. I undertook an invaluable internship at Mp. Biomedical is a prominent biomedical company in California. This experience allowed me to work on a project dedicated to creating a next-generation sequencing kit. I deepened my understanding of PCR and qPCR techniques and analysis, adapting them to suit the project's specific needs by crafting tailored experiments. Beyond the lab bench, I embraced the world of bioinformatics, utilizing the Bio-Star to decipher and analyze intricate sequence datasets. The fusion of hands-on experimentation and computational analysis enhanced my understanding of biomedical research, offering deep insights into the journey of new medicines from design to production for the market. To augment the analytical aspects of my research, I familiarized myself with computational tools like R and Python. These proficiencies enable me to do some data analytics, providing data-driven insights into material behavior, enhancing visualization, and facilitating efficient decision-making processes during the biochemical polymer research process. Guided by the synergy of chemistry, biology, and engineering, my passion lies in therapeutic development and biomaterials. Biomaterials hold the potential to cure persistent illnesses and enhance biocompatibility, while drug development addresses both ongoing and immediate health challenges. My ambition is to craft antiviral drugs targeting polymerase inhibitors and explore nanomedicine in biomaterials. I envision designing nano polymers infused with self-supplying antibiotics for targeted drug delivery and surface treatments, mitigating inflammation risks and adverse effects. By leveraging nanomedicine, we can revolutionize medical practices. With a background in chemical engineering, I appreciate the depth of innovation required, demanding interdisciplinary expertise. My grasp of chemical synthesis facilitates polymer design, my understanding of biology ensures human relevance, and my engineering knowledge evaluates industrial viability. As I look forward to deepening my collaboration with Professor Ju and remain inspired by Professor Oleg Gang's work, I'm positioned at this intersection of multiple disciplines, prepared to drive forward therapeutic breakthroughs and reshape healthcare innovations.

"021687000","{""SOP"":""Daniella Jimenez I was first introduced to biomedical engineering as a rising senior in high school as I participated in a six-week intensive summer program where I learned about applying engineering principles for clinical translation. Since this experience, I have felt an inclination towards the field and sought out opportunities such as internships to exercise biomedical engineering work. During my undergraduate career, I chose to achieve an understanding of the physical sciences and majored in biochemistry while minoring in mathematics; however, I always maintained biomedical engineering in sight. Thus, pursuing a Master’s degree seemed to be the most natural next step in my academic career. Upon enrolling at Columbia University for my Master of Science in biomedical engineering, I recalled my greatest learning experience at the Ultrasound & Elasticity Imaging Laboratory where I interned for almost two years as an undergraduate student. Here, I dabbled in both wet and dry laboratory skills as I executed experiments to assess the acoustic stability of lipid-shelled microbubbles under therapeutic ultrasound which are typically used for focused mediated blood-brain barrier opening. Specifically, I learned how to make microbubbles and prepare tissue mimicking phantoms to characterize the acoustic cavitation occurring within safe focused ultrasound parameters. Within this work, I was also exposed to coding as we used MATLAB to analyze the data acquired. This experience allowed me to learn beyond attaining a skill set. Among the life lessons I received, I recognized the importance of mentorship. I had the privilege to work with a postdoctoral mentor who, from the beginning, established his trust in me as a young researcher. As a result, I felt confident in my own thought processes and abilities to execute an experimental design and was more likely to ask questions and express concerns due to his approachability. Consequently, the following summer I was successfully able to lead nine interns in conducting their own individual projects as I channeled the mentorship that was Daniella Jimenez provided to me. I credit this experience for highlighting teaching as an unequivocal skill. I understood that the ability to simplify advanced concepts such that others can comprehend was necessary to impart knowledge and keep students encouraged and motivated. This was one of the most important skills I learned as an intern and that which I continue to embody as an instructor at the CCNY Stem Institute, as a tutor, and now as a mentor once more upon my return to UEIL. UEIL has taught me invaluable skills. In addition to the significance of mentorship, troubleshooting and optimization have also been emphasized. Upon my return to the lab, I have had the incredible opportunity to perform research as a Master’s student and grew to be independent rather rapidly. As my lab mentor graduated, I was given the rare opportunity to inherit her work and undertake work to be presented at one of the lab’s most prestigious ultrasound conferences. While this was an exciting experience, it was also quite daunting as I was tasked to design experiments and optimize factors such as staining and imaging protocols and perform in vivo murine research. I was entrusted to investigate the effects of focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening on the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier which has never been studied before. Here, it was inevitable to become overwhelmed as the research and the skills were incredibly novel, let alone with the anticipation of deadlines. Fortunately, I relied on my thought processes as well as the expertise of my colleagues whose collaboration facilitated the progress of the research. Through this experience, I recognized the difficulty of leading a project at first hand. However, I became confident in my ability to optimize factors in the workflow of an experiment. Moreover, I further emphasized the need for collaboration and teamwork in order to produce a fruitful outcome. At this point in my academic career, I am confident that the work I have executed and the experiences I have undergone have prepared me to take on the next step - to enroll in a doctoral Daniella Jimenez program for biomedical engineering. I envision myself practicing the skills I have attained thus far and building upon them such that I will continue to make advancements in the field. I look forward to mentorship opportunities where I can share what I have learned and inspire others, especially those resonating with my background, to conquer trailblazing experiences, including pursuing graduate studies. Specifically, I am excited to continue to explore the potential of ultrasound applications, promising potential for noninvasive resolutions to our most critical medical needs, including the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. I am confident that I will be successful in achieving my goals within this endeavor as I strive toward becoming a doctoral student in Professor Elisa Konofagou’s Ultrasound & Elasticity Imaging Laboratory."",""Resume"":""DANIELLA A.

"703824610","{""SOP"":""StatementofPurpose My introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) happened during my sophomore year when I enrolled in the Fluid Mechanics course. I vividly recall a defining moment when the professor showcased a brief video highlighting his recent research. The video featured a mesmerizing visualization of flow patterns around a circular cylinder. Witnessing the intricate flow dynamics surrounding what appeared to be a simplegeometricshapeleftaprofoundimpressionon me. It was this moment that ignited my interest to delve deeper into the world of CFD. I consider myself fortunatetohavestudiedatoneofIndia'spremierinstitutions,withanacceptancerateofless than 2%. This esteemed academic environment provided me with unparalleled opportunities to collaborate with highly knowledgeable and experienced professors. I wholeheartedly embraced these opportunities to expand my horizons and deepen my understanding of fluid dynamics and computationalsimulations. In the subsequent summer vacation, I worked as an intern at DHIO Research and Engineering, India, where I was introduced to the different aspects of the CFD simulation: geometry creation, meshing, setting up the solver, applying boundary conditions, and interpreting the results. I learned about meshing and the importance of using a good mesh. Furthermore, I learned how to perform mesh independence study and validation study, an essential precursor to any research work. Most notably, I learned how tounderstandandinterprettheflowdatageneratedfromthesimulations.The final project of the internship was to simulate a cyclonic separator and predict its separation efficiency using ANSYS Fluent. TheprojectwasundoubtedlyagatewayformeintothefieldofCFD, anddespitehavingsuchasteeplearningcurve,Ilearnedmanythingsduringtheproject. As I found my sophomore year internship on numerical simulations interesting, I took a Numerical Techniques course in my junior year, instructed by Dr. Pritanshu Ranjan. Here I learned about the inner workings of CFD solvers. The course taught me how numerical simulations aredone,starting from the governing equations, converting them to linear systems of equations, applying boundary conditions, and solving them using iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel, TDMA, and the use of under-relaxing and over-relaxing factors along with other concepts. The first half of the course focused more on Finite Difference Method (FDM) and its limitations while the next half focused on the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation using Finite Volume Method (FVM) and its implementation using staggered gridsanditerativealgorithmssuchasSIMPLE,PISO,andPIMPLE. As a part of the curriculum, I implemented some of these techniques in MATLAB codes to model well-knownproblems,suchasLidDrivenCavityandPoiseuilleFlow. Having developed abetterunderstandingoffluidmechanics,Iwishedtoexploreitsuseinreal-world problems. Prof. Kiran Ramesh at the University of Glasgow guided me in my junior year summer internship project to study the flow physicsofanairfoil-basedturbinetoextractenergyfromtides.In this project, I used a Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) based in-house solver written in Julia to simulate the performance of the turbine. The project was very insightful as I learned about the state-of-the-art research in tidal energy extraction. I also learned about DVM, a method where individual vortex elements are used for simulation in contrast to a full-fledged simulationcarriedout in CFD. The project also introduced me to aeroelastic modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) andsubsequently,manyofmyresearchprojectsexploredthisarea. In my junior year, I took a design-oriented project course offered by our university, under the guidance of Dr. Vaibhav Joshi.

I used FEM to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, the structural equation, and the mesh movement equation. The governing equations were solved in the moving mesh Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework. I developed the MATLAB code for 2D two-way coupled problems and used it to study anaeroelastic airfoil. I also worked under the guidance of Prof. Pritanshu Ranjan, to study passive flow control techniques for drag reduction using OpenFOAM. I was inspired to study this topic after learning about the use of dimples in golfballs.Throughthisproject,Idiscoveredthatthroughoptimalplacing of dimples on the exterior of geometry, flow separations can be prevented, which significantly reduces the drag. In the subsequent semester, I also had the opportunity to work under the supervision of Prof. Sridhar Ravi, at the UniversityofNewSouthWales,Australiatoexploretheuse of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), whichisadimensionalityreductiontechnique.Ideveloped codeinJuliatoperformDMDontheflowdataextractedfromthein-houseCFDsolver. My collaboration with Dr. Joshi also served as my introduction to the realm of biomimetics. One aspect that particularly piqued my interest and kindled my desire for further exploration was the study of fluid mechanics in collective motion among variousspecies,includingthecoordinatedflight of bird flocks and the synchronized swimming of fish schools. What intrigued me about these phenomena was their evolutionary development over millions of years, resulting in highly efficient and specialized modes of movement. Hence in my undergraduate thesis at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, I explored the fluid dynamics of triple synchronous flapping foils under the guidance of Dr. Yao. This was a challenging topic for me because I soon realized that the mesh movements I had used earlier were notfeasibleduetoexcessivemeshdeformation.Toremedythis problem, I used the Overset (Chimera) mesh technique, where the mesh attached to the structure moves independently of the background mesh, and the flow variables are interpolated between different meshes. UsingOversetmeshesandOpenFOAMIstudiedtheproblem,varyingthespacing between the airfoils. I identified the primary thrust generation mechanism, which was due to the formation of a Leading Edge Vortex (LEV) which generated favorable pressure gradients. For multi-foil systems, I also studied the vortexinteractionsbetweentheupstreamanddownstreamfoils andclassifiedthemaccordingtotheefficiencyandthrusttheygenerated. At Columbia University, I always wanted to combine myknowledgeoffluidmechanicswithrobotics, particularly with its applications in underwater robotics. Therefore, as a first step, I developed a bipedal walking robot, completely from scratch, starting with a concept sketch, initial and detailed CAD design, electronics, and even programming. I uploaded the journey video to YouTube as well (link). Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of robotics, I also had the opportunity to learn more about MachineLearning,ReinforcementLearning,andGPUcomputing,whichIcontinuedtoexplore inthefuture. My interest in GPU computing and itsapplicationstoCFDledmetopursuesummerresearchunder the guidance of Dr. Shaina Kelly at Columbia University where I developed JLBM.jl, a high-performance, GPU-accelerated software to model flows written in the Julia programming language. The software utilizes the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), which is a method of Computational Fluid Dynamics where the Boltzmann equation is solved instead of Navier Stokes equation. The software harnessed the massive parallelization capabilities of the GPU through the CUDA library and achieved 90% memory utilization. I am also currently working on publishing my work with Dr. Kelly. In the final semester of my Master’s program, I will continue toworkonJLBM.jl andapplyittomodelporousmediaflows. My passion for teaching and research has driven me to actively pursuerolesasaCourseAssistant (CA). DuringmysecondsemesteratColumbiaUniversity,IhadtheprivilegeofservingastheCAfor the Robotic Studio course, under the instruction of ProfessorHodLipson.Thiscourse,knownforits inclusivity in accommodating students with diverse backgrounds, presented me with the valuable opportunity to assist students across various aspects of their robots, ranging from CAD design to electronics and programming. An important skill I cultivated during this experiencewastheabilityto distillcomplexconceptsintoconciseexplanations. In thecurrentsemester,IamhonoredtoholdthepositionofCourseAssistant(CA)fortheAdvanced Fluid Mechanics course instructed by Prof. Gerard Ateshian. As a CA, I take an active role in creating challenging and engaging homework assignments to help students in their pursuit of advanced knowledge in fluid mechanics. Serving as a CA continues to provide me with a profound appreciation for the rich diversity of individuals I interact with daily, each bringing their unique academicbackgroundsandlifeexperiencestotheeducationallandscape. As a prospective doctoral candidate at Columbia University,Iaspiretonurturemyprofoundpassion for research and continue to build up on my graduate research work using the Lattice Boltzmann Method to study the complex problem of Carbon Storage in porous rocks. Columbia University's unwavering commitment to research and its strong ties to industry provide me with an unparalleled opportunity to channel my research efforts toward makingameaningfulimpactontheworld.Having said that, I am also interested intheworkofDr.PierreGentineintheareaofclimatemodelingusing different computational techniques. Particularly, I am interested in using the Lattice Boltzmann Methodtothelargescaledynamicsoftheatmosphereandtheeffectofclimatechange. My ultimate career ambition is to become a professor, where I can apply my acquired knowledge and honed skills to tackle real-world problems. Consequently, Iapproachtheprospectofembarking on a rigorous Ph.D. program at Columbia University with unwavering optimism and confidence.

"238953425","{""SOP"":""Statement of Purpose Jihwan Kim Full Time Ph.D. in Columbia University/ 2024 Spring I intend to apply for a Ph.D. program at Columbia University focusing on research in security systems and secure machine learning. My goal is to devise solutions that enhance the use of cryptographic algorithms, ensuring high-security levels, and bolster the robustness and security of machine learning. Currently, I am a software engineer in the wallet R&D Group at Samsung Electronics, contributing to the ‘Blockchain Keystore Project’ and ‘Digital Car Key Project’ under the Mobile Experience Division. My role involves developing applications founded on various cryptographic algorithms, such as MPC and ZKP, ensuring optimal security. Recognizing my contributions and potential, Samsung has granted me financial support through their internal fellowship program for my entire doctoral journey. I received my bachelor’s degree in computer science and engineering from Sogang University in February 2015. During my undergraduate years, I was part of the Samsung Software Membership program, An initiative designed to identify and nurture IT talent at an early stage. Here, I undertook several projects including Android game and note-taking applications. These experiences solidified my passion for smartphone – related software research, leading me to join Samsung Electronics. At Samsung Electronics, I was initially with the Samsung Health group, tasked with the porting of sensor drivers in the Android kernel and using HAL to deliver the sensor values Jihwan Kim from the Android kernel to the Android framework. While implementing various protocols and interfaces, such as sysfs, i2c, ioctl, and so on. I delved deep into the operational principles of Android, mastering the platform architecture, which positioned me to contribute to diverse Android projects. Notably, as part of Samsung Health, I enhanced sensor drivers and algorithms for heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, innovations now utilized in the Galaxy Watch. Shifting to the Blockchain R&D Group, I ventured into TrustZone development within the Blockchain Keystore project, sparking my interest in Blockchain research. I've played pivotal roles in the project, from developing signature algorithms for various cryptocurrencies to integrating ZKP algorithms. I managed private keys in TrustZone so that private keys can be stored safely in mobile environments. I developed an application that can hold keys and enable signatures to be made at the TrustZone level and support third-party coin wallets. To elaborate, I developed an algorithm for signatures used in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Klaytn, Stellar, and Tron in TrustZone. In addition, I developed the logic to manage the keys in wallets such as BIP32, BIP44 within TrustZone. Moreover, I developed the Blockchain Keystore app to support third-party DID apps, as well as third-party wallets. I implemented the private data used in the Hyperledger Indy in TrustZone, and also newly implemented the ZKP algorithm and applied it to the app. I implemented various encryption algorithms based on a limited memory and a low-level language in a secure OS environment. Moreover, currently I am trying to search for journals related to the application of Multi Party Computation technology to the Blockchain Keystore app and also trying to implement it in TrustZone. This project is currently used in the Samsung Blockchain Keystore app. The Samsung developer homepage also provides it as a SDK, thus everyone can easily use the APIs related to cryptocurrency. Moreover, I've been actively participating in the Digital Car Key project, collaborating with multiple automobile manufacturers, in line with the standards set by the Car Connectivity Jihwan Kim Consortium (CCC). My focus here is on software that manages private keys in TrustZone, facilitating encrypted communication with automobiles. In the realm of security, I am particularly intrigued by vulnerabilities. I aim to explore groundbreaking algorithms and methodologies that bolster machine learning model resilience against adversarial assaults, while ensuring data privacy. The research endeavors of Professor Junfeng Yang, particularly in secure systems and the robustness of machine learning, align seamlessly with my ambitions. Under his guidance, I am confident in advancing my knowledge, especially relating to cryptographic algorithms and their vulnerabilities. I would like to enroll in a PhD program to research secure systems that operate efficiently and safely in mobile environments. More specifically, my aspiration is to design a platform that democratizes the use of cryptographic technologies in smartphones, particularly through TrustZone.

As part of my master’s course work, I performed multiple research projects starting from a Systematic Literature Review in \""Fraud detection in online payments using machine learning techniques\"", this research provided in depth knowledge about various supervised and unsupervised ML techniques and their pros and cons, it also helped me on how to analyze and validate the obtained results. In short, it gave me a complete picture of how research is done on a professional level. The positive experience from this research opened doors for me to take up research assistant role for the summer of 2019 in Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden where I was involved in two research projects, one where I had performed statistical and machine learning analysis for studying the characteristics of the communication network of a bus and also for analyzing the possibility of any system error and the second one being my favorite which is custom path planning for turtle bot robot in a specific lab environment using A* and Dijkstra’s algorithm, the take away from this role was collaboration with professional researchers, exploring diverse domains and also understanding the importance of resources for performing research work. Apart from this I have also performed research work in \""Trusted computing in Containers\"" which involves understanding of various steps and key components that are involved in building trust within different hardware and software components of a system and the possibility of implementing the same in container technology. Next comes my master thesis where 6 to 8 months of sheer dedication was put by me in researching on the topic of \""Design and Implementation of Key Exchange Mechanisms for Software Artifacts using Blockchain Technology\"" in collaboration with both the industry as well as academia. In short, my thesis included finding out the possibility of decentralizing the authentication functionality of Public Key Infrastructure and designing a framework which is compatible in an Artificial Intelligence marketplace. A different view about research was perceived by me from the experiences gained during the master thesis, be it learning completely new technologies namely blockchain, distributed systems, cryptography, cloud technologies etc. or the experience of collaborating with industry and following the industry standards and trends, managing the unforeseen situations due to Covid lockdowns mainly the unavailability of visiting the university campus and accessing the resources. Proper planning and interaction with the supervisor helped me manage it. The most important lesson learned by me during my thesis was to have patience, persistence, adaptability and most importantly inspiration to complete any research work and I am not only proud of completing my thesis on time, but I am also happy that my thesis till date has received 1400 plus hits and 600 plus downloads which is the highest in my class. After my masters, I briefly worked for 7 months as a software developer in Ericsson, Gothenburg, Sweden. It was during this time I didn’t find any excitement in my work as nothing new was done in the industry, rather the same old development of functionalities based on the customer input. Even though it was hard, I took the decision to quit my job and travel across Europe to rethink what I wanted to do in my career. Travelling helped me a lot by not only allowing me to explore different cultures and traditions but also helped me get introduced to new people. I made sure I interacted with different researchers across Europe who gave insights on how things work in graduate research and tons of other questions I had on pursuing a PhD. After a lot of thought I understood my role and purpose, which is research and build technology that enhances human life and I see PhD as the only way to fulfill this. I intend to apply for graduate studies in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I choose this field as it aligns to my previous education, research as well as my future goals of implementing an intelligent system that replicates humans which can solve complex problems in a cost-effective manner with the help of software and PhD would be the first step in achieving it. Though I am flexible enough and open to ideas for the topic of my graduate studies I would like to conduct my research in communication/coordination, perception or design of system architecture for AI systems. Few of the topics I am currently educating myself or self-researching are \""distributed coordination of multi modal robots in complex environment\"", for this topic I am mainly focusing on the architecture of communication among the robots and prioritization of tasks using machine learning by considering various parameters such as robots’ current position, environmental conditions as well as the goal needed to be achieved. Next, I am also interested in \""Prediction of human emotions using brain computer interface\"", in this topic I look forward to research on processing signals from the electrodes strapped on human head in predicting the emotions such as anger, happiness, etc. by statistically mapping raw signal data to different color codes and later try to replicate the model on to the system and predict it under various conditions as I feel this may be the early stage for transferring human consciousness on to a chip. I am also interested in researching on building a software architecture for satellite systems to process and predict the imagery in the satellite compute systems itself rather than sending the raw data back to earth which would cost a lot of time and money. I am also open to topics that align with my goal. Meanwhile I also founded an Artificial intelligence consulting firm in India once I returned from Europe. The firm successfully deployed a computer vision application for a medical diagnosis start-up where we had to use OCR/ICR along with natural language processing to understand and predict the issues, treatments and medications handwritten by doctors. Later I had a great offer from another company where it assured me of mass hiring my employees and giving them a great salary package which I couldn’t offer them, which I happily agreed to, and I had to eventually close my firm. In a significant professional development, I now work as a MLOps engineer at a company called One Convergence, I am currently involved in building \""Pluto,\"" an AI system that enhances user workflows, like agents for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, Pluto's scope extends beyond a limited number of agents, providing integration for complex tasks and harnessing the power of Gen AI at its core. I also embrace cultural diversity and bring unique talents to the table. I am an avid guitarist and tabla player, and I possess a profound knowledge of ancient Indian scientific scriptures, such as Sutra, Sulbas, and Vedas, which encompass age-old scientific wisdom. This cultural richness not only enhances inclusiveness but also offers a different perspective that can contribute to a comprehensive research environment. I take this opportunity to apply for graduate education at Columbia University, keeping in mind my long-term goals. Working in a graduate position would provide me with an excellent opportunity to collaborate with world class researchers, it would also help me get associated with leading industrial organizations. After speaking to current and graduated PhD students from Columbia, I was fully impressed by the diversity, support and inspiration it provides for an individual to grow in his/her career. I understand the dedication, patience and inspiration required to have a great research career and I believe I have groomed myself technically as well as for having the right attitude and mindset for such a career. If you feel I am the right person whom you’re looking for please do connect to me as I will be more than happy to introduce myself and explain in detail my skill set, talents, and vision. Thanks in advance!

Research Work Reduced sampling method for robotic path planning Ongoing ∗ Designing an algorithm to generate less and optimal sampling points when compared to probabilistic road map(PRM) and rapidly exploring random tree(RRT). The algorithm is first being implemented in 2D environment by converting the map into a Cartesian plane. Unlike PRM and RRT this algorithms focuses on connecting the start and goal points using shortest distance which is a straight line and whenever an obstacle is encountered it traverses across it’s perimeter by making sampling nodes and equal interval, at every interval it checks if the straight line from it to the goal is in free space configuration, if so path is found or else the process continues until the whole perimeter of the obstacle is traversed and later shifts to other obstacles if any. Aim of this process is to eliminate the complexity and no of sampling nodes done by previous algorithms. Master Thesis - Design of Key-exchange Mechanisms using Blockchain.

"413834948","{""SOP"":""Wai Tak Lau (Michael) Personal Statement: Computer Science PhD at Columbia University ChatGPT told me that the determinant of a diagonal matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements, but it should be the product instead. 1Although trivial in this case, large language models hallucinating pose a serious problem when used in domains such as healthcare. One of the central problems in modern deep learning is that it fits to observational distribution and does not consider the cause and effect between different variables. These problems have motivated my research interest: 1) Learn causal representations of high-dimensional and multi-modal data, that allows models to perform well on unseen data and when few labels are available. These representations can be reused to build new models iteratively ; 2) Using the learnt causal representations for developing machine learning models in healthcare, applying to diseases classification, biomarker discovery and clinical deployment. I discovered my passion for research much later than my peers. When applying for masters program during senior year undergrad, my goal was to go into industry as I had yet to gain in depth knowledge and problems that I am passionate about. However, this changed as I dove deeper into different areas in machine learning and discovered many interesting and important problems. This led me to work in the AI4VS lab, led by Prof. Kaveri Thakoor, along with other amazing collaborators. Over the process, I grew to enjoy research and gained valuable experience. I have keen interest and am now looking to further develop my skills at Columbia University. 1 I asked ChatGPT to generate math questions and it failed to provide the correct answer. 1 Wai Tak Lau (Michael) Research at AI4VS Lab Data scarcity is one of the main problems in machine learning in healthcare, involving not only gathering a large amount of training data but also obtaining high- quality labeled data for training supervised algorithms. I am excited to address this problem by using data of different modalities, similar to how text and images can be combined. At AI4VS lab, we used eye tracking data to address this problem. Eye tracking has long been used to understand the subject's cognitive process when examining stimuli, and the relationship was proposed in the Eye-Mind hypothesis [1] [2]. Eye tracking data reflects the regions and order of importance as clinicians examine the reports, and they can be used as surrogate information that acts as labels in a situation where ground truth is not available. Most of the current approaches when using eye tracking data with images ignore the temporal aspect of the data, therefore the challenge is to create a reasonable encoding to capture both spatial and temporal relationships. To address this problem, I designed a new way to encode eye tracking information as words, inspired by natural language processing. A transformer encoder based model is then used to train with a multitask objective to learn meaningful embeddings where eye tracking on similar images are close to each other. Our goal is to use these embeddings to generate pseudo labels to train a model that uses optical coherence tomography (OCT) reports of the retina to predict Glaucoma (a neurodegenerative disease that leads to blindness). Although we need more data to support this conclusion, the results have shown that eye tracking data aids downstream tasks like Glaucoma classification. More surprisingly, eye tracking data alone achieves relatively high accuracy in classifying Glaucoma. During this process, I learnt how to maneuver in the complex search space of possible hypothesis and convert a hypothesis into concrete problems that we can solve. I presented this work at Columbia 2 Wai Tak Lau (Michael) Center of AI Technology Symposium: AI & Healthcare and I am working to submit this work to as the first author. In the context of healthcare, I am interested in developing and applying techniques in causal representation learning to learn interpretable representations that can aid understanding new biomarkers, interpretability and be used for downstream applications such as segmentation or even hypothesis generation. As a first step, we can work towards a joint embedding space between images and eye tracking, and even text from clinicians inspired by CLIP [4]. Other Projects and Experiences One interesting application that arises from GANs is performing image translation by generating samples from the conditional distribution P(x|y), where y is the input image and x is the translated image. However, this translation might not be accurate due to lack of conditioning on set of covariates z. For example z could be which city we would like to translate input into in Cityscape dataset [1], since different cities might have different architecture style. To overcome this challenge, we can not only generate from P(x|y,z) but also take into account the causal relationships, where each variable is modeled by a neural network. Figure 1: Example inputs and outputs from CityScape Dataset [1]. The dataset is collected from different cities. Left is the input, and right is output. 3 Wai Tak Lau (Michael) As I embark on my research journey, I have realized in many ways research is similar to entrepreneurship as they both require extreme ownership. During my undergraduate studies, I ventured into the entrepreneurial world through the Alchemy program at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), lead by Professor Sanjay Patel. Our goal was to build a minimum viable product for predicting realtime audio quality in the hopes that this information could be helpful for improving audio delivery and ultimately video as well. There were two main challenges: finding high quality training dataset that contains audio degradations and the real- time constraint. To solve the first problem, we decided to build a synthetic dataset by collecting our own data using Amazon Mechanical Turk. I helped design and build the survey as well as the different simulators to generate the synthetic audio dataset that consists 30 hours of audio. This gave me the chance to dive into audio quality metrics, compression codecs and audio quality degradations. To address the second problem, I also suggested the two stage features extractor and regression model to accommodate the real time needs. Ultimately, the model performed competitively and I learnt how to pivot around a obstacles creatively. At Columbia My long term goal is to become a researcher in using machine learning to enhance healthcare. I am especially excited to work with Professor Kaveri Thakoor and Professor Richard Zemel. I specifically want to work in the AI4VS Lab, as the lab and my interests aligns in robust and interpretable machine learning in healthcare using data from different sources and different modalities. Professor Richard Zemel’s interests in few-shot learning and continual learning aligns with my interest learn useful representation that allows model to perform well when few labels are available and build models iteratively. I appreciate the close connection between the medical school and the computer science department, making it the ideal environment for me to transition from theory to application. With the excellent faculty, students 4 Wai Tak Lau (Michael) and collaborative environment, Columbia is the ideal place for me to continue my academic journey. References 1. Just, M.

"282670368","{""SOP"":""I’ve got a good taste of the discipline over the four years of chemistry study in college and two semesters of graduate chemical engineering courses. Applications of chemistry and chemical engineering in various fields have opened my eyes. In my undergrad, I joined a research program to coat polyacrylamide gel with polydopamine (PDA) catalyzed by H O / Fe3+ which would be used for wound infection treatment 2 2 when the COVID pandemic forced me to stay back in China. This specific gel would offer photothermal disinfection from the nature of PDA and chemodynamics disinfection from hydroxyl radicals derived from H O and Fe3+. The gel could 2 2 potentially cover skin laceration and speed up curing. Moreover, it is porous so the skin wouldn't be in anoxic environment. Another lab I joined in my undergrad was DNA nanotechnology lab. We strove to customize DNA strands and assemble into polygonal shapes. One advantage of such making is its potential of drug delivery carrier due to miniscule size and good chemical bonding with drugs. During my graduate school period, my degree concentration is energy and climate. Some memorable courses include: green chemical engineering, CO2 capture and utilization, and electrochemistry. In Green Chem, we learned how to design chemical product with minimum sources and how to leverage profit margin and environmental impact. This idea would truly influence me when I conduct lab experiment. Other classes also shape my understanding of the world. Since my undergrad was in chemistry, I only had minimal exposure to industrial trend and society. Having learned Carbon Capture & Utilization and Electrochemistry, I notice the world is in drastic need of renewable and clean energy. These courses experience make me more fascinated about the energy and climate field. Few semesters of lectures could suit me with an overview of chemical engineering industries. However, a deep understanding of specific field would be only realized by dedicating years in PhD study. So far, I participated in Prof. McNeil’s lab to explore how to selectively deposit lead ions over other heavy metal ions under the supervision of Dr. Narouei. The research makes me have deeper understanding in electrochemistry. I realized one can modify the surface of electrode by depositing it with gold nanomaterial or with organic acid. The modification would enhance the chemical and physical bonding of lead ions to the electrode surface, and therefore benefiting the electrodeposition of lead. Columbia University intrigues me for its world renowned academia and its location in New York City. NYC offers me numerous stress-relieving events provided that I am in a anxious mood. Moreover, this metropolitan is the pivot of massive academic network. Connection with people from both industry and academy would provide me with insights for my future lab research. Moreover, I’m very looking forward to studying and working with distinguished professors specializing in materials, climate, and environment to explore real life applications. For example, the research topics on electrochemistry and battery from Prof. Alan West are really alluring. His projects emphasize on sustainability and alternative energy from which I am exciting to learn more. Other fascinating projects include Prof. Kumar’s pioneering exploration of inorganic nanoparticles for the polymers to unleash numerous potentials for biomimicry, energy storage and conversion. There are many other outstanding professors like Professor Esposito who has done brilliant work in fuel cell and solar ene. It would be such an honor if I were to work closely within their lab and manipulate state of the art facilities. Continuing either one of their studies will go a long way towards addressing my concerns about sustainability and enable me to develop practical designs that benefit people’s lives."",""Resume"":""ZIFENG TANG 775 Columbus Ave, New York, https://www.linkedin.com/in/zifeng- tang-03917a214/ (917) 912- 6024 NY, 10025 zt2309@columbia.edu EDUCATION Columbia University New York, NY Master of Science in Chemical Engineering, Overall GPA: 3.62 Expected Dec 2023 Sample Coursework: Carbon Utilization and Conversion, Green Chemical Engineering, Electrochemistry New York University, College of Art and Science New York, NY Bachelor of Science, Chemistry, Overall GPA: 3.64, Major GPA: 3.87 May 2022 Sample Coursework: Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, inorganic Chemistry, Intro to Computer Programming Award: George Granger Brown Award in Chemical Engineering, Isidore Rubiner Award in Outstanding Chemical Research WORK EXPERIENCE Columbia University in the City of New York New York, NY Research Assistant & Technician Jan 2023 - Present • Joined Prof. Faye McNeil's lab for electrochemistry research focusing on environmental problems.

"482179155","{""SOP"":""Huangyuan Su Fall 2024 Personal Statement My past research interest lies in the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) with robotics, computer vision, language models, and gametheory, etc. What excitesme themost isto develop agentsor algorithmsthat arerobustand generalizable. Applied ReinforcementLearning andRobot Learning As a MS in Machine Learning studentatCarnegieMellonUniversity, Ihave hadtheprivilege to work under the supervision of Prof. Jeff Schneider and Prof. Ruslan Salakhutdinov. My first project at CMU found that the anchor embeddings used by recent trajectory prediction approaches can parameterize distinct discrete modes representing high-level driving behaviors. We propose to perform fully reactive closed-loop planning over these discrete latent modes, allowing us to tractably model the causal interactions between agents at each step. We validate our approach on a suite of dynamic merging scenarios, finding that our approach avoids the frozen robot problemwhich ispervasive inconventional planners.Our approachoutperformsthe previous art inCARLA on challengingdense trafficscenarioswhenevaluated atrealistic speeds. In the next project [4], we use diffusion models to perform language-guided closed-loop planning for autonomous driving. Counter to conventional wisdom, we show that excessive conditioning information can hinder downstream planning performance due to poor generalization and lack ofdiversity. Additionally,weshowthat gradient-basedoptimization(e.g. classifierguidance)canactually perform worsethan sampling-basedoptimization(e.g. CEM/ES) for guided diffusion sampling. To this end, we introduce a novel sampling-based guidance method DiffusionES which handles arbitrary non-differentiable black-box objectives without retraining. We use LLMs to map language instructionsto programswhich adaptivelycontrolthe behavior of our planner through reward shaping. With language supervision, our approach can synthesize highly complex behaviors (e.g. aggressive lane weaving) not present in the training data. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios through languagefeedbackfrom ahumanexpert. After submitting these two projects to ICRA 24 and CVPR 24, we started work on using video games for studying human-AI or multi-agent collaborative decision making in disaster management. With Prof. Salakhutdinov, we have been working on solving robotic control problems under domain randomization across tasks and robot morphologies (hand, dog, arm) by distilling classical optimization algorithms(MJPC) into visuomotorpolicies. Improving Reinforcement LearningAlgorithms using TheoreticalTools In my first research project [1] during my bachelor at Nanyang Technological University, we tackled the failure of standard Policy iteration (PI) relies on Bellman’s Principle of Optimality under time-inconsistent (TIC) objectives, such as non-exponentially discounted reward functions. Specifically, we consider an infinite-horizon TIC RL setting and formally present an alternative type of optimality drawn from game theory: subgame perfect equilibrium, that attempts to resolve the aforementioned questions. Drawing on these observations, we propose backward Q-learning, a new algorithm in the approximate PI family that targets SPE policy under non-exponentiallydiscountedreward functions. Huangyuan Su Fall 2024 Then [2], I noticedthat the learnedrepresentationof a𝑄-networkand itstarget should,intheory, satisfy a favorable distinguishable representation property. Specifically, there exists an upper bound on the representation similarity of the value functions of two adjacent time steps in a typical DRL setting. However, in experiments, the DRL agents may violate this property and obtain asuboptimalpolicy.Therefore,weproposeasimple yeteffectiveregularizercalled Policy Evaluation with Easy Regularization on Representation, to maintain the distinguishable representationproperty.These twoworksarepublishedin TMLRandCVPR 23,respectively. Futureplan In my previous research endeavors, a significant portion of my time was dedicated to refining model architectures and hyperparameters. This challenge is exacerbated in the realm of RL, where the optimization of distinct parameter sets for different scenarios within the same task is common practice. This intricate process poses a significant obstacle when attempting to deploy our agents in real-world settings. Issues such as data shifts and long-tail scenarios often lead to system failures. Given the current momentum in industry towards integrating AI workers to complement or substitute human roles, it becomes imperative for these AI entities to possess specific qualities, including robustness, safety, and consistency. Additionally, an essential attribute is their capacity for reasoning, enabling them to produce decisions that are not only refined but also explainable to humans. The ability to incorporate feedback for continuous improvementiscrucial, as theconsequences of inadequateperformance canbe severe. While certain studies [5, 6] suggest that agents based onLLMsoutperformRLagentsor exhibit zero-shot generalization, it is evident that their generalization capabilities remain constrained. Consequently, I strongly advocate for the development of better architectures, frameworks, or training schemes. For the first year of my PhD, I plan to explore various avenues, including leveraging generative (pre-)training for robust 3D recognition, distilling knowledge from pretrained LLMs to mitigate the intensive sample requirements for training autonomous agents, and addressingthepaucity oftheoretical analysisindeep learningmethods. Looking ahead, my career goal is to work as a professor, contributing to research that yields trustworthy AIagentsor systems,while mentoringandguiding motivatedstudents. Why ColumbiaUniversityandComputerSciencePh.D.? Based on my experiences, I've come to recognize that effective problem-solving and the discovery of new, compellingchallenges require guidancefromthe mosttalented, insightful, and experienced researchers. Among them, I am particularly drawn to the distinguished faculty at Columbia University, including Junfeng Yang, Carl Vondrick, Zhou Yu, Richard Zemel, and Tony Dear. Their groundbreaking contributions in vision, NLP, and robotics, occasionally influenced by RL, strongly resonate with my researchinterests.A thorough examinationof their research, coupled with insights gained from perusing their lab environments, has strengthened my desire to collaborate with them. In enrolling in thisCS PhDprogram, myforemost goalis to undergo systematic and comprehensive research training, honing my skills in problem-solving, enriching my expertise in my specific area while fostering a broad understanding of the field. The program's resources for students planning faculty careers is particularly attractive, as it alignsseamlessly withmy long-term aspirationsof contributingmeaningfullyto academia.

"236052530","{""SOP"":""My name is Zeyu Wang, and I am a Chemical Engineering student from Dan Steingart’s group. Looking back, I became fascinated by chemistry during high school, primarily as a result of my chemistry teacher’s personality and charm, while his particular teaching method made me want to learn about chemistry more than any other subject. When we studied inorganic molecular configuration, my teacher explained it from the aspect of electrons with valence bond theory, which was well beyond the level of typical high school teaching. Similarly, when it came to chemical equilibrium, he liked to use formulas and apply his knowledge of thermodynamics. Ultimately, it was such an approach that made me appreciate the charm and magic of chemistry. As a result, I chose to major in chemistry at Fudan University, and studied hard to acquire much more knowledge about this field. Based on the foundational knowledge gained from my classes at Fudan University, I was part of a group that began to conduct research into functional polymer. The project aimed to synthesize some new types of polymers, to resolve certain problems, with a view to putting them to practical industrial use in the future due to the promise offered by their outstanding electricity performance. During this experience, I was responsible for the organic precursor synthesis for polymerization. The main problem I had was finding the optimal conditions to enhance productivity, especially since the initial productivity level was only about 20%. To improve this I decided to approach it from two perspectives. One of these involved improving my technical skills in the synthesis process, such as wiping out oxygen and water, as well as working on column chromatography purification, which turned out to be very effective as the productivity rose to around 40%. The other approach entailed optimizing reaction conditions, but as the reaction process included several steps, it was a real challenge to be precise with finding the key point. Inspired by what I had learned from the course, I thought the Grignard reagent might play a more important role in the reaction, so I began optimizing reaction parameters, such as the ratio, the temperature, and the adding rate of the Grignard reagent in this process. However, the experiments didn’t always go as planned, and when extracting and condensing some white substances appeared. Through H- NMR, I discovered that it was the remains of the pinacol, one of the reagents. To resolve this issue, water was added to the system to dissolve the pinacol, and then diethyl ether was used to extract the target product. I’m very pleased to say that the results drew praise from the professor. This experience enabled me to obtain a good grasp of basic experimental skills and enabled me to tackle the problems I encountered during experiments. Meanwhile, I recognized that there are various obstacles and challenges when undertaking scientific research, which demand huge amounts of efforts and hard work, meaning that I have to maintain a consistently positive attitude when encountering such difficulties. I continued with the work of flow polymerization and wrote a review on computer- aided flow polymerization. First, we carried out a comprehensive exposition on flow polymerization, combined with computers and algorithms. This serves to address the gap in this field to some extent, as computer technology is novel in polymerization. After reading a large volume of previous work on computer-aided flow synthesis in the field of organic chemistry, to help us acquire knowledge of the most advanced computer techniques, we drew an analogy between small organic molecule synthesis and polymerization. Thereafter, the most recent research into the flow polymerization based on computers were incorporated and divided into four sections: high-throughput living polymerizations in flow; programmable regulations of dispersity profile; sequence and topology for polymers modular design with online monitoring; and self-optimized living polymerizations in flow. This work on polymers and flow synthesis led me to chemical synthesis with algorithm and computer technology, which impressed me greatly. During my studies in chemistry, and my work in polymer science within the laboratory, I firmly believe that I have been equipped with an excellent level of knowledge in chemistry and material science, and have also fostered a series of experimental skills, which have encouraged me to keep progressing in the field of scientific research. When studying in Columbia University, I joined Yang’s group and learned a lot about the polymer electrolyte, K-S battery and battery cycle test in the first semester. After that I joined Steingart’s group, taking charge of the program on lithium recycling from NMC811 powder, while I also participated in the program on recycling metallic hydroxides from batteries into a sodium-ion battery cathode precursor. I successfully recycled lithium from NMC811 powder with bromine at over 90% efficiency, without leaching out any other metals, including cobalt, nickel and manganese. The same experiment condition was carried out on LFP powder, and a similar result was achieved. Controlled experiments were carried out with sulfuric acid system and sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide (piranha) system, and the bromine system showed great selectivity and reaction efficiency over lithium. Due to my curiosity about the composition of the residues after leaching, XRD, SEM and EDS were utilized to confirm both the element composition and structure of the solid. In addition to studying experimental skills and the many characterization techniques, I also developed the ability to solve the problems I have encountered in the scientific research process like the balance between feeding pop density and reaction rate, the separation of liquid-solid phase with the presence of bromine, and unusual color change during the reaction. The solution appeared magenta only in the reaction of residues with sulfuric acid after bromine leaching, while the samples taken at different timepoints during the reaction turned brown and precipitated overnight. Following time spent reading a range of other papers, I figured out what had happened to this system based on the ICP and EDS data. After several years’ work in the lab, I firmly believe that I am equipped with the enthusiasm, recognition and necessary professional skills to continue my journey in the field of scientific research. I am really interested in polymer and battery, which I think has been, and will always be, of great importance in society, and I hope that I am able to make even some small achievements within these fields. I am very hopeful that I can join Columbia’s PhD program to keep chasing my dream, especially as Columbia is making great advancements in the field of energy, offering me the very best stage for my studies. Furthermore, I have been working in CEEC and Dan’s group for quite a while, meaning that I am familiar with the work and instruments in Chemical Engineering. I have also made many friends with other PhD students in Chemical Engineering, and we have offered one other a lot of help as we have pursued our research. As I look to the future, I sincerely hope I can keep studying and working in Columbia’s Chemical Engineering department."",""Resume"":""Zeyu Wang Email. zw2853@columbia.edu | (646) 255-7271 30 Morningside Dr, Apt 608 New York, NY 10025 EDUCATION Columbia University New York, NY M.S. in Chemical Engineering Sept 2022 - Expected Dec 2023 Fudan University Shanghai, CN B.S. in Chemistry Aug 2018 - Jul 2022 RESEARCH EXPERIENCE Research into Battery Recycling January. 2023- Now Advisor: Professor Dan Steingart, Columbia University ➢ Selectively leached lithium from NMC811 and LFP with efficiency higher than 85%. ➢ Recycled and separated different metals from NMC811 through piranha digestion and solvent extraction at different pH. ➢ Analyzed the composition of the residues after NMC811 powder bromine leaching with SEM and XRD.

"445177306","{""SOP"":""For a long while, I have been captivated by the wonders of that chemistry created in the domain in life sciences. The way the chemical reactions and molecular interactions are almost like a hidden language revealing the mysterious story of life. This fascination has fueled my academic journey and drives my curiosity to delve deeper into the intricate world of life sciences. Pursuing my undergraduate and master's degree in chemical engineering, only further deepened my passion for the field. Through a PhD, I aim to explore new research areas, make meaningful contributions and collaborate with esteemed researchers to address complex challenges, particularly in protein engineering from a chemical engineering standpoint. Fundamentals of chemical engineering are vital in protein engineering for designing and optimizing bioprocesses by studying their kinetics through different chemical reactions, enabling the production of valuable proteins for various applications. As a master's student, my practical engagement, including participation in courses like Biopharmaceutical Process Laboratory, and my involvement in Dr. Banta's Research Group has significantly enhanced my practical skills as well as theoretical understanding. Notably, my research endeavors, such as exploring protein-ligand interactions through various analytical methods, provided me with a platform to excel in experimental design and data analysis. Our research on metal binding proteins deepened my appreciation for the intersection of molecular biology and chemical engineering, motivating me to pursue a PhD in these areas. During the research I had to explore the behavior of various intrinsically disordered proteins by culturing them in the lab and then performing analytical experiments such as Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and Circular Dichroism (CD) to analyze the binding affinity of those proteins to different rare earth elements. Subsequently, I used various softwares to perform protein-ligand docking in order to view the coordination chemistry and examine the correlation between the structural motifs and the ligand binding sites. Doing so would bring us a step closer towards screening out suitable proteins that can be used in biomining to mine out rare earth elements. I am genuinely intrigued by biotechnology, one of the applications of chemical engineering to refine proteins, a process exemplified by directed evolution and rational design. This field possesses the potential to revolutionize industries and enhance human well-being. This technique allows scientists to selectively alter specific DNA sequences within genes, resulting in tailored changes in protein structure and function. Such precision engineering can lead to the development of novel proteins with optimized properties, ranging from enhanced therapeutic efficacy in medicines to more efficient enzymes for industrial processes. My time at Columbia University, including a summer spent on research, not only advanced my technical capacity but also involved mentoring new students who significantly contributed to my research in the later stages. Teaching them the basics of laboratory techniques in a stepwise manner along with the concepts revolving around them not only reinforced my understanding of the concepts surrounding the experiments we conduct but also improved my ability to handle multiple tasks while conducting my own research. Working simultaneously on multiple projects, including assisting fellow researchers, has honed my teamwork, troubleshooting, and leadership skills, fostering an environment of shared scientific pursuit. After just seven months, I have learned a lot of hands-on techniques and methods of data analysis. However, when I see the depth of knowledge my mentors at Columbia University have, it's clear I have much more to grasp. I believe there is still a wealth of learning for me here, and that is why I am eager to extend my stay and dive into a PhD program. Columbia offers a unique environment for me to gain a deeper understanding of science and research, and I am excited to explore these opportunities further. My ambition involves combining hands-on experimentation and computational simulations to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing protein functionality. Subsequently, I aspire to leverage this profound understanding to engineer innovative solutions for significant challenges within the realm of biotechnology. This educational journey will equip me with invaluable skills, knowledge, and a strong network, empowering me to make a meaningful difference in the realm of chemical engineering. I am excited about the potential for growth and exploration that a PhD offers, and I embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in my academic pursuit."",""Resume"":""PIYUSH KUMAR +1 646-240-8689|piyush.k@columbia.edu|https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushskumar/ EDUCATION Columbia University, New York, NY Masters of Science in Chemical Engineering; GPA: 3.92/4 Expected Dec 2023 • Relevant Coursework: Computer Simulations in Biology, Solid State Chemistry in Pharmaceutical, Advanced Chemical Kinetics, Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics, Project Management.

"128093427","{""SOP"":""Shao-Ju Wang A 3.66 GPA is not among the bests of your applicants. And yet, I am proud of it when it comes to completing dual degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering plus a minor in Computer Engineering within four years of college. My college education aim was to build the most holistic training in different engineering disciplines possible because I believe that better problem-solving skills and ideas come from a combination of knowledge and skills from various perspectives. Therefore, I tried to reach this goal with dual degrees with a minor and research projects with professors of different engineering backgrounds. And now, I am ready for my next aim of focusing and sharpening my knowledge and skills in Automatic Control and Embedded Systems. Within automatic control, I am especially interested in AI and robotics that free-up manpower, particularly those requiring less cost to own and operate. At Penn State, I accomplished two projects involving computer vision, one in a fruit fly 3D model and the other in a metal deposition. These two projects show me the unlimited potential of how computing can help remove redundancy works and automation's potential. Furthermore, living in a developing country for six years, I had the opportunity to witness some deplorable living conditions where Shao-Ju Wang Shao-Ju Wang people don't even have access to essential utilities. Those encounters have motivated my quest to improve technologies and devices that are beneficial and affordable to those with limited resources. And I believe that my graduate training in automatic control will be the way for me to achieve that goal. The second area of specialty that I would like to acquire further is embedded system. To achieve the goal of building affordable devices that aid people, I am eager to learn more about the architecture of embedded systems, particularly microcontrollers. At Penn State, I took courses in algorithm frameworks, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and microcontrollers and MIPS architecture. I aim to tackle the optimization problem with both software and hardware approach; achieving more than double effectiveness. My interest in research projects began from my favorite course at Penn State, CMPEN 454, Introduction to Computer Vision. The course combines the physical world, bits, and math altogether. After taking the course, I began working with some of the professors at Penn State, developing computer vision programs that aid their research. First, I joined Professor Jean Shao-Ju Wang Shao-Ju Wang Mongeau's Bio-motion Systems Lab of Mechanical Engineering to help them recreate a fruit fly 3D model with stereo images. Although I did not work on the core computer vision code, I helped optimize the user experience and learned a lot about the techniques and flow. After completing the project, I assisted Professor Sanjay Joshi from Industrial Engineering in creating a program that automatically determines the dimension of metal deposition from the cross- sectional image. Meanwhile, I am developing a single-lens camera distance detection algorithm that works on the phone with Professor Kyusun Choi in Computer Engineering. This device will detect obstacles in front of a micromobility to prevent traffic accidents. These project experiences in software and low-power hardware have shown me my limitations in these areas, the fun of finding solutions on my own or within a team, and, more importantly, the urge to study further. Not only did projects with the professors in engineering research, but I also helped Professor Yunting Liu from Electrical Engineering in settling and improving her lab session in EE 413, Introduction to Power Electronics. I assisted her and her TA in finding and solving the missing or confusing parts of the lab operation. I also made some technical suggestions on the Shao-Ju Wang Shao-Ju Wang typesetting of the lab manual. From this experience, I learned the development process of lab design and how to conduct the lab. I enjoyed the teamwork research with the professors and their team members. And yet, I am also trying to solve some of my questions in engineering on my own. The project on converting USB PD to ATX motherboard connections is my own attempt to solve the complexity of desktop power. Conventional ATX power supply takes several cables to supply power to the motherboard, while I am trying to provide the power with a single USB type-c cable. There are still many engineering questions that I wish I could find the answers to and the solutions from my training in your Master's program. In my last year of undergraduate education, I was the treasurer of the IEEE- Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) honor society. Aside from managing cash flow, I enjoyed tutoring members and non- members on electrical and computer-related coursework and assisting them with course selections. I was delighted when I could find ways to help these students understand the concepts they tried to learn in class. It was a mutually beneficial experience because I learned to express Shao-Ju Wang Shao-Ju Wang myself better and thought more profound about this knowledge or skills. And I hope I will have more of these opportunities in the future. Academic education in CS, EE with a minor in CE exposed me to the spectrum between hardware and software. From project and tutoring experiences, I know I want to be a researcher and a professor at the university in my career life. Therefore, I am working step by step toward that goal. The CS graduate program at Columbia University has been one of the best in the world. I will be able to learn research skills that will further lead me to the future goal, learning from and contributing to our world as a professor. My life goal is to develop and improve technology to improve human life, especially for those with limited resources.

Fairness Guarantees Under Distributional Shifts and Causality. During my research on providinghigh-confidencefairnessguaranteesforrepresentationlearning,Ilearnedthatclassical statistical tools may be inadequate in guaranteeing fairness in the presence of certain distribu- tionalshifts,suchascovariateshifts(Singhetal.,2021). Conductingastatisticaltestonaholdout test set is insufficient to ensure the validity of the results when experimental conditions change. Additionally, these distributional shifts significantly affect the robustness and generalizability of ML models (D’Amour et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023). Several studies have suggested that these problemsstemfromtheabsenceofcausalformalisms(Pearl,2019;Kaddouretal.,2022),andhave proposedincorporatinggraphicalcausalitytodistinguishshift-invariantcausalfactorsfromspuri- ouscorrelations,includingtaskslikecausaldisentanglementofrepresentations(Yangetal.,2021), invariantfeaturelearning(Sunetal.,2021;Luetal.,2022),andcausaldomainadaptation(Singh etal.,2021). Iamcuriousunderwhatcircumstances(e.g.,datadistributionsandavailability)can theidentifiabilityofthefairnessconstraintsbeguaranteed,howtoconstructfairnessguaranteesus- ingcausalformalisms,andhowgeneralizabletheyareunderdistributionalshifts.

Today,manylarge-scaleMLsystemsaretransition- ingtotrainingfoundationmodelsonextensivedatasetsandthenadaptingthesemodelsthrough fine-tuningtovariousdownstreamtasksacrossdiversedomains(e.g.,GPT-4(OpenAI,2023)). Some recent work has shown that foundation models can improve robustness to distribution shifts due totheirtrainingondiversedataencompassingawidedistribution(Radfordetal.,2021). However, theirrobustnessislimited,particularlywhenfine-tuningthefoundationmodelforfew-shotlearn- ing because it can distort the pre-trained feature extractor (Xie et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022).

"600922991","{""SOP"":""STATEMENT OF PURPOSE While pursuing my master’s degree in Biomedical Engineering (BME) at Duke University, I had the privilege of exploring a range of research domains in Machine Learning (ML) such as Digital Image Processing, Generative Modeling, Robustness and Bias in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Signal Processing. Based on this experience, an intersection of biomedical signal processing and multimodal machine learning has emerged as a focal point for my PhD aspirations. ML research in BME has predominantly focused on unimodal learning tasks, usually using one type of modality (biomedical images, medical records, wearable sensor data, etc.) but real-world biomedical data is often a combination of multiple modalities in conjunction with abstract con- cepts (disease progression, treatment response, patient outcomes, etc.). Human learning is usually multimodal involving interpretation of complex entity relationships and interdependencies between variables and concepts from different modalities. To make machine learning models capable of such inference, we need to capture these complex interdependencies with multimodal learning into one model. With that in mind, I am interested in focusing my Ph.D. research on developing machine learning models for such multimodal learning with special emphasis on biomedical applications. During my first semester, I got captivated by the role of generative models in drug discovery, leading to my research project on “Reinforcement Learning for Generation of Novel Non-toxic Molecules” under the guidance of Prof. Daniel Reker. I used a generative model trained with the Chembl dataset and compared classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, MLP) on the Tox21 dataset, optimizing the network for non-toxic structure generation. SVM, with the highest recall, was integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, resulting in a bias towards non-toxic molecules in the generated compounds. This research project kindled my interest in generative modeling. Robustness in AI, is a new paradigm in machine learning that aims to develop AI systems that are resilient to noise, uncertainty, and unexpected changes in their environment. I was introduced to this concept while working on a research project to build ML models using microscopic image data that had spherical aberrations, which often hampers the precision of segmentation tasks under Prof. Roarke Horstmeyer. As a team, we developed a solution that involved integrating a trainable physical layer into the UNET network architecture. We evaluated three different versions of this solution and found that employing Zernike polynomials for correction demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy. It would be highly advantageous for healthcare AI models to possess the capability to autonomously correct themselves and maintain consistent, reliable performance, even when confronted with inherently aberrant or inconsistent datasets. Fairness and Bias in AI, especially in healthcare, is of paramount importance. I explored bias in clinical prediction models to study the effect of race on model performance under Prof. Jessilyn Dunn. I evaluated the predictive capabilities of machine learning algorithms for 30-day hospital readmission after hip fracture repair surgery, specifically examining potential performance dispari- ties by race. I employed random forest with lasso regression for this work. However, underrepresen- tation of minority classes in the existing datasets underscores the need for more diverse healthcare datasets for future research, a fact that I would like to be mindful of in my future research activities. I have been fortunate to be involved as a Research Assistant (RA) in two of Duke’s Biomedical Engineering laboratories. My experience as an RA in the Computational Optics Lab under Prof. 1 Roarke Horstmeyer has reinforced my interest to pursue further research in the vision and image processing domain for my PhD. I gained hands-on experience in cell image data acquisition, pro- cessing, and annotation. I acquired and processed this data using a microscopic system at various magnifications, and developed code to annotate cells in low-magnification images and transfer an- notations to higher-magnification counterparts. My work to transfer annotations between images of different resolutions could be used to develop new methods for multimodal learning that can handle data from different modalities with different resolutions. Since last summer, I have been actively working as an RA on building ML models using temporal biomedical signals for assessing Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) in mice models. This work is being done at Duke’s Applied Machine Learning Lab under the guidance of Prof. Leslie Collins, Prof. Boyla Mainsah, and Dr. Bradley Kolls. Our research introduced an automated approach for feature extraction from EEG data. We developed a convolutional autoencoder to condense EEG signals, preserving vital information while reducing dimensionality. These encoded features were then used in clustering and topic modeling techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), torevealhiddenpatternsinTBIdata. Thismethodologystreamlinesanalysisanduncoverscomplex relationships, offering valuable insights for TBI research and assessment. We are further exploring modern clustering methods like BertTopic to investigate TBI severity and recovery patterns in mice models. This work aims to develop machine learning tools that can be used to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of TBI, and to identify new therapeutic targets. During my undergraduate years, I have been fortunate to get an opportunity to do research under the guidance of many eminent researchers from University of Pennsylvania, Stony Brook University and MIT-ADT University Pune. One project that stands out is a project on transfer learning for oral cancer detection, a collaboration with Stony Brook University and a dental hospital1. With real patient data, I worked to use pre-trained image classification models (InceptionNet, MobileNet and ResNet) and applied transfer learning strategies to oral cancer data, achieving a 10-15% accuracy improvement. We summarized this work as a research paper uploaded on arXiv, and I was very delighted to learn that my first paper has been cited by various research groups several times. IhavealsobeenaTeaching AssistantfortwocourseswhileatDukeandIhavethoroughlyenjoyed my teaching experience. Each experience thus far has proven to be a great source of motivation leading me to decide to pursue a career in academic research. I strongly believe academia is one of the most impactful careers that provides an avenue to drive research and push the boundaries of knowledge. I would like to continue in academic research after my PhD. To embark upon an academic research career path, Ph.D. at Columbia University is undoubtedly the appropriate next step for me. Columbia is one of the esteemed research institutions in the world where Biomedical AI research is already underway. I want to be part of such research efforts that will certainly define the course of tomorrow’s AI research in healthcare going forward. I would be honored to have an opportunity to do research work under the guidance of Prof. Elham Azizi, Prof. Andrew Laine, Prof. Nima Mesgarani, Prof. Kaveri Thakoor, and Prof. Sanja Vickovic, as their work is highly synergistic to my PhD research interests as outlined above. I am confident that with my relevant research experience, intellectual curiosity and team spirit, I will be able to contribute effectively to Biomedical AI research and my research group. 1https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11610 2"",""Resume"":""RUTWIK JAYANT PALASKAR rutwikpalaskar@gmail.com (cid:135) https://github.com/RutwikP (cid:140) https://rutwikp.github.io/ fl http://www.linkedin.com/in/RutwikPalaskar SUMMARY Interested in interdisciplinary research combining Machine Learning, Healthcare and Bioengineering.

"802277818","{""SOP"":""Junru Zhou Having studied Computer Engineering, I have received some of the most rigorous training at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the University of California, Irvine. The strong curriculum with courses focusing on algorithms, programming languages, software engineering, and computer systems, has laid for me a solid foundation in adopting system-level perspective and problem-solving skills for both real-life and simulated scenarios. But the real education occurred when I took this knowledge and applied it to a variety of projects. In these hands-on contexts, I honed my mastery of programming languages such as Java, Python, C, and C++, and tools such as Git, TensorFlow, and Firebase, among others. For example, I developed a proxy server that would manage HTTP requests from clients through seamless conversion into HTTPS requests and implemented an access control list-based request filtering system to optimize network performance. With my hard work and continuing education, I have received the Dean’s Honor and have accomplished a GPA of 3.31 out of 4, and I finished my undergraduate degree in four years. During my graduate study, I extended my knowledge based on what I learned during my undergrad to areas such as Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Network Science. I have accomplished a GPA of 3.40 out of 4. This academic experience, I believe, is strong proof of my qualifications to become a worthy candidate for your program. During my undergraduate studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I encountered a significant academic obstacle related to the C programming language. The sudden global pandemic necessitated a shift to online learning, which presented Junru Zhou unique challenges for mastering the intricacies of C, a critical subject in my Computer Engineering program. Unlike traditional in-person classes, C programming demanded a deep understanding of syntax, data structures, and low-level memory management. Unfortunately, the online environment made it difficult for me to grasp these fundamental concepts effectively. I recognized that adapting to online learning required a different set of skills and strategies. So, I decided to take a proactive approach to address this challenge. In July 2021, I took the initiative to apply for a teaching assistant (TA) position for C Programming and Data Structures, both of which I had excelled in previously. As a TA, I was responsible for conducting weekly discussion sessions, answering students' questions, and reviewing key course materials related to C programming. To fulfill my role effectively, I adopted a rigorous approach to my learning. I revisited the course materials, collected various examples, and sought clarification from professors on topics I had previously found challenging. This thorough preparation enabled me to explain complex concepts to students clearly and concisely. This hands-on experience improved my own C programming skills and made me more aware of potential pitfalls in my coding practices. Beyond technical skills, my role as a TA also honed my communication, leadership, and presentation abilities. In my role as a research assistant in Professor Qian Chen's lab at UCSC, I collaborated on a Computer Vision project, \""Identity Tracking with Little Training,\"" focusing on person tracking using Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision-RF Fusion.

I contributed to model refinement by identifying and correcting data inaccuracies, leading to improved model accuracy and noise reduction. This experience not only deepened my understanding of Computer Vision and its practical applications but also sharpened my programming skills and problem-solving abilities, fueling my passion for further exploration in this field as I pursue doctoral studies. Engaged in the development of the Long Marine Lab Stranding Map project, I played a significant role in bringing this geospatial data visualization initiative to life. Leading a team of four developers, I adopted Scrum methodologies, ensuring efficient collaboration and on-time project delivery. Our objective was to create a comprehensive database visualization map to track cases of stranded marine life. On the front end, I worked extensively with JavaScript and React to design user-friendly layouts. Leveraging the power of Mapbox GL, we incorporated robust mapping functionalities into our project, ensuring that users could interact with the data effectively. Meanwhile, on the backend, we harnessed the capabilities of Node.js to manage data efficiently. Our database management was a critical aspect of the project's success. To this end, we made use of Firebase and Algolia for indexing and retrieval, ensuring that users could access information swiftly and accurately. Throughout the development process, I collaborated with my teammates, conducting peer code reviews to identify and address Junru Zhou bugs while also optimizing our database management strategies.

"467395093","{""SOP"":""PhDApplication inMechanical Engineering,Columbia University Yucheng Yang Personal Statement My fruitful academic journey commenced with a unique catalyst: Losartan, an ARB antihypertensive medication from Merck. My grandmother, a hypertension patient, relied on it. Regrettably, pharmaceutical companies in China were unable to independently develop this drug at that time, forcing patients to rely exclusively on imports. This situation imposed astronomical healthcare costs on my family and became a source of sorrow for my grandmother. I still remember independently seeking alternative medical products due to these financial upheavals, and as I delved deeper into the intricate world of chemical drugs and medical products, I realized chemistry, as a foundational discipline, underlies all drug synthesis, and the mechanisms of chemical reactions are crucial for novel medical products development. Consequently, I found a profound passion for the vast and divergent field, which guided me to Southeast University for a Bachelor’s in Chemistry,laying a solidbasis for future innovationsin medicalproducts. Recognizing the integral role of synthesis in medical product development, I joined Prof. Hao Wang’s group during my undergraduate studies to build a robust foundation in organic synthesis, focusing on silylene-related compounds. Due to the product’s sensitivity to water and oxygen, I proficiently operated a glovebox and Schlenk-line after mastering fundamental organic synthesis methods, such training in anhydrous and anaerobic operations greatly honed my skills in chemical synthesis. Subsequently, I applied my synthetic foundation to drug development, collaborating with enterprises on the process synthesis of omeprazole intermediates in Prof. Haibin Zhu’s group, bolstering skills in synthesis and characterization, and found my interest piqued by applying theoretical research to industrial production. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, presented disruptions to my wet-lab experiments. Undeterred, I pursued a project with Prof. Erik Liujten at Northwestern University to perform computational simulations on graphene PhDApplication inMechanical Engineering,Columbia University Yucheng Yang using software like LAMMPS, Moldy and Materials Studio to develop a model for graphene's thermal conductivity with various sizes and temperatures. This aided me in predicting material properties,thus enablingbetterdesign ofwet-lab experiments for medicalmaterials development. Theresultswere published inThe 2ndEuropean SymposiumonComputer andCommunications. As in-person teaching resumed, I joined Prof. Zhihai Ke’s group at the Chinese University of Hong Kong to further develop functional products with practical applications through organic synthesis. We aimed to synthesize graphdiyne (GDY) and HKUST-1 metal-organic framework (MOF) on copper foam to create a novel GDY-MOF catalyst, amplifying the catalytic effect of HKUST-1 by promoting its electron transfer efficacy. Tasked first with synthesizing high-purity GDY, my expertise in anhydrous and anaerobic handling proved to be invaluable. Although failing to grow ideal GDY initially, after literature research and improvisation, I got an optimal morphology GDY by decelerating solution-dropping rate from 3h to 12h. Subsequently, Prof. Ke and I probed the catalytic distinctions among MOF, GDY-MOF and GDY through the phenol oxidation reaction catalyzed by H O , and strategized to augment the yield of water-phase 2 2 catalysis reactions by attaching a polymer layer. I devised a potent method to attach polymer to MOF without disrupting GDY by suspending GDY-MOF with cotton threads and demonstrated the water-phase catalytic effect could be enhanced by attaching polymers, with the GDY-MOF- Polymer group showing the optimal catalytic yield. These findings were published on ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces,and anotherpaper for GDY synthesis was submittedto Chemistry of Materials. This project enriched my comprehension of two-dimensional nanomaterials synthesis and potential applications,pivotal formy transition fromtheoretical to independentapplied research. My pursuit of applying theoretical research to generate applied results guided me to Columbia, where I pivoted my major to Chemical Engineering for its application-oriented focus. PhDApplication inMechanical Engineering,Columbia University Yucheng Yang Initially, I grappled with my direction, as my research honed my expertise in materials science, yet my interest leaned towards biotechnology. Fortuitously, meeting Prof. Qiao Lin clarified my path, revealing a direction melded my interests and skills by applying MOFs and nanomaterials to medical devices, notably Biosensors and BioMEMS. Recognizing my zeal for pursuing a Ph.D., he proposed two research topics: developing graphene-aptamer sensor for tacrolimus detection in collaboration with Prof. Stojanovic, and enhancing TNF-a aptamer sensor’s shelf- life—a challenging yet vital endeavor. After preliminary experiments, I identified sensor limited shelf-life issues from aptamer detachment, degradation and graphene surface damage. To mitigate this, I chose glass surface to firmly attach TNF-a aptamer via covalent GA-Coupling for developing long-time fluorescent TNF-a sensors. Another approach, using Ni (HITP) MOF to 3 2 covalently couple -NH on TNF-a aptamer to MOF’s organic framework, didn't work 2 significantly since aptamer still needs to be connected to Ni (HITP) via linkers. Nevertheless, 3 2 this effort proved intriguing, it allowed growing highly conductive MOF films on sensors rapidly and effortlessly via dropping and heating MOF particles, outpacing graphene's CVD method. Subsequently, I transitioned to ZIF-90 MOF, eliminating the demand for linkers by directly connecting -NH on aptamer to -CHO on ZIF-90 to enhance sensor shelf-life. However, ZIF-90's 2 conductivity required improvement to proficiently convert chemical signals to electrical ones. Leveraging my chemistry background, I increased ZIF-90’s conductivity to 2.26×10-2S·cm-1 by introducing sulfonic acid groups through an aldehyde group's addition reaction with bisulfite, while -CHO transformed into -OH, ensuring compatibility with -NH on aptamer. Currently, I’m 2 ardentlyengagedin this project,aiming to developstable andenduring biosensorsfor patients. My ventures thus far have staunchly affirmed the role of material science as the cornerstone of mechanical manufacturing. To deepen expertise in device manufacturing and electrochemical PhDApplication inMechanical Engineering,Columbia University Yucheng Yang sensor development, I engaged as a RA in Prof. Yuan Yang's lab in the APAM department. Coincidentally, this was also a shelf-life extension project. Herein, I crafted Covalent-organic framework (COF)films to inhibitLi dendrite growthon Cu in Li+ batteries, thereby safeguarding against punctures and extending battery shelf-life. After a meticulous literature review, I chose COF over MOF due to its lower conductivity, ensuring no diminution in cell efficiency due to charge transferon COF film. I thencompared TAPB-PDA and Tp-TTA COF, both boasting high mechanical strength and suitable pore sizes, ultimately selecting TAPB-PDA for its simpler synthesis. Through continuous adjustments in reaction time and concentration, I concluded that a 0.7μm COF film significantly enhanced battery shelf-life. This project sharpened my skills in nanosynthesis, cell assembly, electrochemical workstations, and characterization techniques like AFM, SEM, FIB—all crucial for fabricating sensor electrodes and analyzing electrical signal changes during sensor testing. It also inspired me on sensors shelf-life extension project with Prof.Lin byintroducingadditional covalentbonding sites foraptamers throughCOF. These experiences have ingrained in me a familiarity with mechanical engineering, a field seamlessly merges varied scientific and engineering ideas to troubleshoot practical challenges, defining my sustained emphasis on the interdisciplinary domain of MOF/graphene and biosensors, propelling me to devise BioMEMS for innovative clinical applications, and sparking myenthusiasm to develop affordableyet efficientmedical productsforchallenging diseases. I’m intrigued by Columbia ME Doctoral program, especially the MEMS & Nanotech and the Bioengineering & Biotech focus. The interdisciplinary approach combines nanomanufacture and biomedicaldevices enablesme to nanosynthesize MOFand graphene to innovate BioMEMS, tackling medical care problems. New York is the epicenter of the world, and Columbia stands as the focal point within the vibrant metropolis, offering an inclusive and diverse culture, cutting- PhDApplication inMechanical Engineering,Columbia University Yucheng Yang edge research facilities, and unparalleled collaboration opportunities with industrial companies, the advantages of which I have deeply appreciated in my master study. My goal within the program is to amplify my expertise, hone my skills, and engage in profound collaborations with healthcare sectors, globally disseminating my research on highly efficient and enduring biosensors for disease monitoring, advancing medical technology and positively impacting patients worldwide. Specifically, I am enthusiastic about developing unique fluorescence sensors on glass and addressing the short shelf-life issue of TNF-a aptamer sensors with Prof. Lin during my Ph.D. journey. Building upon improvements using ZIF-90 to covalently bind aptamers, my goal is to modify TNF-a aptamer’s chemical structure to mitigate its auto-degradation. Furthermore, I plan to collaborate closely with Prof. Stojanovic to craft robust MOF and graphene sensors for assorted drug assays. Additionally, I aspire to delve into electrochemical sensorswith Prof.Yang, investigatingalternative detectionmethods forbiomarkers. My ultimate aspiration is to forge an academic career, autonomously pioneering on novel biosensors for societal betterment. Although anticipated challenges loom, my robust foundation in chemistry, materials science, engineering, and data analytics thoroughly armors me to embrace them with open arms and overcome them with unwavering enthusiasm, diligence, and perseverance. Guided by our motto, 'In the light shall we see light,' my pursuit of knowledge's illumination will perpetually persist, aiming to shine light onpatient solutions through research.

"032288797","{""SOP"":""Personal Statement PhD in Chemical Engineering Yipeng Zhang Columbia University 2023/08/29 I still remember the feeling when I was accepted into the Chemical Engineering Master of Science Program at Columbia University. I felt delighted to be accepted to my dream school, but I also felt pressure. I knew it must be a difficult process, and I was worried that I would not be able to overcome these challenges. The admitted students were all outstanding, and I doubted my qualification to study and compete with them. But very soon, I turned this pressure into motivation. At the end of the orientation day, I stood under the Alma Mater statue, appreciating the beautiful campus under the golden sunset, with one ambitious fantasy in my mind — becoming a PhD student at Columbia. Now, as I enter the last semester of my MS degree, I feel confident that I will succeed as a PhD student in a research group at Columbia. I received my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from University at Buffalo, SUNY in 2022. In my undergraduate, I took fundamental courses in chemistry and chemical engineering, which provided me with basic knowledge for doing research. I also mastered how to use MATLAB and Python as tools for data analysis. My first research experience as an undergraduate was with Dr. Kun Zheng’s group at the Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences for summer research. Dr. Zheng’s research focuses on designing materials with high thermal performance. I participated in the project to enhance the interfacial thermal conductance of epoxy and alumina composite interfaces. I co-authored one article on this research in Journal of Physics: Conference Series. My next project involved the synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet (BNNS) polymer composites with high out-of-plane thermal conductivities. I put my effort into doing literature reviews, experimental scheme formulation, and the compilation and sorting of articles. The experience from that summer was my first introduction to scientific research. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to be present in the lab to hold reactions and characterize samples by hand. This sparked my eagerness and curiosity about the synthesis and characterization of those materials in the laboratory setting. Prof. Sanat Kumar provided me with an opportunity to satisfy this desire and curiosity. I joined his research group in the first semester in Columbia, guided by a PhD student who is my mentor. The first project I participated in was the synthesis polymer-grafted nanoparticles (GNP) via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). I learned the fundamentals of ATRP with my mentor and started a series of experiments. Besides reading articles and taking part in the design of the experiment, I gained valuable experience in ATRP synthesis, and using multiple instruments like TGA, GPC, DLS, SAXS, and glove box to characterize the grafted nanoparticle materials. After collecting and analyzing the data, we discussed them with Prof. Kumar during the weekly project meeting and listened to his guidance and suggestions. I focus my contribution on the synthesis and characterization of different GNP samples. A key material parameter is the particle grafting density, i.e., the number of chains connected to the particle. To measure the grafting density of these particles, I carried a series of polymer-chain cleaving reactions with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and characterized the molecular weight distributions of the polymer chains via gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Besides knowing the molecular weight distributions, I also found a small excess of TBAF is enough to cleave the chains from the particle surface and that a large excess of TBAF will break the poly (methyl acrylate) chains. These findings pushed the project forward. Participating in the weekly group meetings is another component of my master’s research. I had the fortune to give one research update to the group members. I made the presentation slides carefully by analyzing data and plotting figures precisely. I practiced my speech with concentration, trying to find the clearest way to explain my research content. I presented with enthusiasm during the group meeting, reporting my work to my peers and letting them feel how familiar I am with my research topic. At the beginning of this summer, my mentor decided to start another project with me. This project is aiming to make anion exchange membranes with quaternized amine fixed charges. This project is a part of an ongoing collaboration with Prof. Ngai Yin Yip’s in Earth and Environmental Engineering. Thanks to my previous experience of conducting ATRP synthesis, it is easy for me to synthesize the co-polymers and characterize them using GPC. In the future, I plan to use H-NMR to identify the chemical species and their composition in the copolymers. The coursework at Columbia provides me with a broader perspective of chemical engineering. I took Prof. Alexander Urban’s atomistic simulations course in the second semester and performed well. In this course, we were introduced to simulation and computation methods for predicting the structure and properties of materials, such as Lennard-Jones potential, Density functional theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and Radial Distribution Function. By doing the course projects, I saw how these abstract theories can be concretized with data and figures. I realized that simulation is a powerful approach for developing new materials besides laboratory work. Additionally, I took Prof. Daniel Esposito’s kinetic course in the same semester. In his course, I learned how to predict the reaction rate and design a reactor by reaction conditions. I also learned the principles of surface reaction (Langmuir isotherm and BET isotherm) and collision theories. I believe these will benefit my future research a lot. Both my undergraduate and graduate research experience make me interested in soft matter, polymers, nanoparticles, and composite materials. In the future, I want to learn and research more about their synthesis, characterization, and applications. I also want to know more about surface chemistry and surface structure for materials and make them be used as fillers, membranes, electrodes, or catalysts. To achieve the target above, I would like to use both laboratory and computation skills. After these years of study and research, I start to realize what scientific research is: it is not only working hard to master synthesis techniques and instrument operations for pursuing experiment results fitting the expectation. It is more like a pursuit of knowledge and truth. Accept an experimental result even if the results may be far from what I want. Try to use the knowledge to explain these results. Share your results with your colleagues and learn from them. Read literature to see if others have measured similar results. Find possible flaws in the experiment. Iterate this process until you make progress. Hard work is the character that a master's student who is new to scientific research should possess, most of us applicants have had it. The ability to conduct independent research may be rare among us, and it is an indispensable quality of a doctoral student. I think, luckily, under the guidance of professors and my mentor, I have initially developed the ability to independently engage in scientific research and cultivated this quality. Conducting research and problem-solving have both become parts of my life. I am eager to investigate more new knowledge in the future with faculty members at Columbia and to make my own contribution to the field. I believe my research experience, skills, and qualities can make me a successful PhD student in Columbia Chemical Engineering. Now, I put my hands off the keyboard, and I leave my desk. Again, standing in front of the Alma Mater statue, gazing at the campus bathed in autumn sunlight, a warm feeling rises in my heart."",""Resume"":""Yipeng Zhang Mailing Address: 43-15 52nd St, Apt 4G, Woodside, NY, 11377 yz4290@columbia.edu +1 6462207846 EDUCATION School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, University at Buffalo (SUNY) B.S. in Chemical Engineering (Cum Laude) Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science, Columbia University M.S. in Chemical Engineering RESEARCH EXPERIENCE Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences, Advisor: Dr. Kun Zheng May 2021 – October 2021 ● Participated in the project aims to improve the Interfacial thermal conductance between filler and polymer matrix using surface treatments. ● Participated in the study of boron nitride nanosheet polymer composite with high out-of-plane thermal conductivity. ● Co-authored an article published in the Journal of Physics: Conference Series.

"001590808","{""SOP"":""Amogh Inamdar Data analysis underpins intelligent decision making, and data representation begets analysis. Representation learning shows promising results in distilling information from big data, but its top performing algorithms are hard to understand and deploy as resilient systems. Studying these challenges was central to my experience as a Master’s student at Columbia University, where I discovered the joys of diving deep into machine learning through academic research. Through a career in research via the Ph.D. program at Columbia, I aim to engineer algorithms that represent data better, leverage them in end-to-end applications, and work towards provable AI explainability. Explainability has long been a key aspect of my research - in my very first graduate research project (supervised by Dr. Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi), I worked with doctors from New York-Presbytarian to create a dataset of spinal deformity patients from HIPAA-protected demographic and medical information. Supervised by Dr. Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi, I used a battery of random forest algorithms with gradient boosting to classify post-operative Proximal Junctional Kyphosis (PJK), a complication that often necessitates re-surgery in patients. By aggregating decision trees and validating calculated risk factors for PJK, I presented potentially actionable insights to medical experts at a regular cadence. Through this, I learned that explainability in AI is non-negotiable in critical fields like medicine, and to design systems that balance explainability with data privacy. Working in medicine was also extremely rewarding. Habituated to task-specific deep learning, I was fascinated by self-supervised learning when I studied the SimCLR algorithm in a class taught by Dr. Richard Zemel. To explore further, I began working with Dr. Zemel on contrastive attribute learning. I adapted the SimCLR algorithm to learn vectors composable from subspaces via multi-head instance discrimination, to constrain variation in image data to perceivable ‘attributes’ like shape and color. Experimenting on the dSprites and CelebA datasets showed that weakly supervised models outperformed self-supervised counterparts on attribute-level tasks, corroborating theoretical findings from Locatello et. al. 2019. Gratifyingly, visualizing data in representation space with t-SNE also qualitatively linked disentanglement and performance. Based on these results, I shifted focus to studying whether large text-image models such as CLIP and Flamingo can leverage language association for zero-shot learning through experiments on attributes datasets like MIT-states. This project 1 Amogh Inamdar sparked my interest in disentangled representations, few-shot learning, and domain adaptation, and I see these as potential focal points of my Ph.D. research. I continue to contribute to it as a working professional and enjoy it greatly. I also have a strong record of engineering praxis. Guided by Dr. Nakul Verma and Dr. Salleb-Aouissi, I built logiclearner.ctl.columbia.edu, a propositional logic practice app, for the Center for Teaching and Learning at Columbia. I developed a system to parse and generate a search frontier for Boolean expressions, optimized heuristics with a genetic algorithm, and adapted A* search to solve logic proofs. Through my research, LogicLearner provides hints on-the-fly from wherever a student may be stuck, which cannot be achieved by precomputing solutions. Recognizing a unique opportunity for self-supervision, I developed a large question bank by backtracking from solution states and used a Siamese GRU to embed expressions in vector space, preserving transition similarity according to logic rules. Used as a heuristic, this network solved many human-generated questions in under a second. Logiclearner has been used in Dr. Salleb-Aouissi’s discrete math class at Columbia, and has motivated me to further study representation learning for non-perceptual tasks. Currently, as a software engineer at Salesforce, I build and manage highly optimized systems that control millions of dollars of cloud infrastructure for the Genie customer data platform. Having worked closely with Dr. Richard Zemel at Columbia, I am keen on continuing my exploration of representation learning and generalizability as a Ph.D. student in his group. Working full-time as a software engineer on a data-driven stack has only reinforced my belief in the need for agile machine learning models. With Dr. Zemel, I hope to explore the frontiers of such models and build robust, explainable models that generalize from small amounts of data. As a returning student, I would be able to make meaningful contributions from day one. Dr. Carl Vondrick’s excellent computer vision course served as my introduction to representation learning, and I was fortunate to take Dr. Zemel’s course alongside his accomplished students. Being especially interested in computer vision, I hope to work on research under his guidance. I am also excited by the breadth of interdisciplinary research at Columbia. While I wasn’t able to work with Dr. Liam Paninski during my MS due to visa work limits, I was privileged to have 2 Amogh Inamdar interacted with him on research in pose estimation. My experience with medical and cognitive science make me well-suited to tackle the fascinating research in computational neuroscience that Dr. Paninski’s group focuses on. Overall, Columbia University presents an ideal environment for my growth as a researcher, with an incredible peer group and faculty with diverse research interests. Through my Master’s degree, I have demonstrated excellence in intense graduate coursework and both core and interdisciplinary research at a high level. My data engineering profession has also made me a strong coder and system designer. My time at Columbia was immensely rewarding but all too brief - as a Ph.D. student, I would mature as an academic and gain a breadth of perspective. After my degree, I plan on continuing research in machine learning and its applications as a research scientist. In the long term, I hope to have a career in academia, combining my love for research and pedagogy as a university professor. 3"",""Resume"":""Amogh Shreedhar Inamdar linkedin.com/in/amoghinamdar amogh.inamdar@columbia.edu github.com/AmoghSInamdar EDUCATION Columbia University New York, NY M.S. in Computer Science - Machine Learning track; GPA: 4.0/4.0 May 2022 Ramaiah Institute of Technology Bengaluru, IND B.E. in Computer Science and Engineering ; GPA: 9.76/10 Aug 2020 ACADEMIC RESEARCH Columbia University New York, NY Graduate Researcher; Advisor: Dr. Richard Zemel Feb 2022 - Present Contrastive Learning of Disentangled Representations ● Extended the SimCLR algorithm to novel supervised and unsupervised contrastive attribute learning paradigms. ● Visualized the effects of data supervision on learned image representation spaces with PCA and t-SNE. ● Developing methods to evaluate the performance of large pretrained models on attribute learning tasks.
