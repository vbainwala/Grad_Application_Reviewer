GPA: 3.9/4.0.\n• Research Assistant (Auton Lab). Teaching Assistant (10708: Probabilistic Graphical Models).\nNanyang Technological University, Singapore Aug 2018 - Jun 2022\n• Bachelor of Science in Mathematical Sciences; Computing and Data Analysis Minor. Highest Distinction. 4.82/5.00.\nDean’s List (Top 5% GPA, Academic Years 2020-2021, 2018-2019).\n• Full scholarship recipient (NTU Science and Engineering Scholarship).\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, United States Summer School. Jun 2019 - Aug 2019\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nResearch Assistant (Large Language Models, Self-Driving), Carnegie Mellon University Aug 2022 - Dec 2023\nSupervised by Prof Jeff Schneider Work on a transformer/diffusion-based formulation to handle multimodality in imitation\nlearning for driving while following natural language instructions. Our aim is to harness the power of language feedback as an\nadditional source of supervision to enhance the feedback loop of conventional autonomy stacks.\nResearch Assistant (Robotic Manipulation), Carnegie Mellon University Aug 2023 - Dec 2023\nSupervisedbyProfRuslanSalakhutdinov.

Significantly advanced the capability of Guide (a core product).\nMachine Learning Engineer Intern (AI/ML Team), Apple May - Aug 2021\nDerived insights using Spark as to how well the personalized Today feed in App Store is performing for our users across 150+\nstorefronts and identify opportunities for improvement. Used the insights to optimize apps recommended to users and built\ndashboards to monitor the performance of different recommendation algorithms.\nPUBLICATIONS\nDiffusion-ES: Generative Evolutionary Search with Diffusion Models for Trajectory Optimization\nBrian Yang, Huangyuan Su, Nikolaos Gkanatsios, Tsung-Wei Ke, Jeff Schneider, Katerina Fragkiadaki. In submission.\nWe propose DiffusionES, a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box\nnon-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search\nfrom a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function in the form of natural language, using LLMs.\nModel-Based Planning with Stochastic Trajectory Prediction Models for Urban Driving\nAdam Villaflor, Huangyuan Su, Brian Yang, John M. Dolan, Jeff Schneider.
