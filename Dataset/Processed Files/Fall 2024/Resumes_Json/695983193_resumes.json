The primary goal was to compare our\nsensor's performance with their custom Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based sensor. Insights\nfrom this project were compiled into a paper that was submitted to ICRA 2024.\n2021/5 - 2022/2 Research and development, United States of America\nIn this collaboration with Boston Scientific, I worked on software development for real-time\n3D shape reconstruction of an optical fiber triplet from measurements obtained by optical\nfrequency domain reflectometry (OFDR).\nOther Memberships\n2021/11 - 2022/11 Treasurer and member in charge of communications, Optica-SPIE Student Chapter\nThis student committee represents Optica and the Society of Photo-Optical\nInstrumentation Engineers (SPIE), two international optical societies, at Polytechnique\nMontreal.
