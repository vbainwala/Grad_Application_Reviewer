JIMENEZ\nNew York, NY\n(347) 259-7724 | dj2357@columbia.edu | linkedin.com/in/daniellajimenez1\nEDUCATION\nColumbia University, Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, New York, NY\nMaster of Science, Biomedical Engineering; GPA: 3.6 Expected December 2023\nMacaulay Honors College, The City College of New York, New York, NY\nBachelor of Science (B.S.), Magna Cum Laude; GPA: 3.59\nMajor: Biochemistry; Minor: Mathematics June 2022\nRESEARCH EXPERIENCE\nResearch Associate, Ultrasound & Elasticity Imaging Laboratory\nColumbia University, New York, NY August 2022 – Present\n• Serve as project leader to assess the potential effect of focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain\nbarrier opening on the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier primarily through fluorescence\nmicroscopy. Experimental design encompassed executing focused-ultrasound blood-brain barrier\nopening in an Alzheimer’s disease model for 10 mice which was confirmed through MRI.\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed for +50 sections which were then imaged through\nmicroscopy and analyzed through ImageJ.\n• Investigate effects of focused ultrasound-mediated blood-brain barrier opening on the gut\nmicrobiome and peripheral organs among Alzheimer’s disease murine models and wildtype mice\n- stool, blood, and spleen samples were collected pre and post-treatment then analyzed through\n16s RNA sequencing and R.\n• Carry out maintenance, training, and responsible for troubleshooting for two laboratory\nmicroscopes.\n• Led 7 summer interns in executing independent projects to characterize microbubble stability\nover one-week post-activation and under various conditions induced through theranostic\nsonications.\nIntern, Grimm Lab\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY June 2021 – May 2022\n• Characterized the role of iron-oxide nanoparticles in reactive-oxygen species-mediated cell death\nin pancreatic cells through flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.\n• Analyzed mechanisms of uptake through fluorescence-labeled and radiolabeled Feraheme in vitro\nthrough viability assays and flow cytometry.\nIntern, Ultrasound & Elasticity Imaging Laboratory\nColumbia University, New York, NY June 2018 – October 2019\n• Conducted in vitro experiments using a tissue mimicking phantom to investigate the temporal\nstability of lipid-shelled microbubbles under therapeutic parameters.\n• Mentored 9 interns in basic wet laboratory skills, the synthesis of microbubbles, and the\npreparation of gelatin phantoms.\nTEACHING EXPERIENCE\nNon-teaching Adjunct, CCNY Stem Institute\nThe City College of New York, New York, NY June 2022 – Present\n• Taught PSAT Math to 15 NYC high school students on Saturdays for the Spring 2023 semester.\n• Taught general chemistry to 32 NYC high school students for the Fall 2022 semester.\n10/07/2024 09:57 Resume 1/3",
