Looking back, I became fascinated by chemistry during high school, primarily\nas a result of my chemistry teacher’s personality and charm, while his particular\nteaching method made me want to learn about chemistry more than any other subject.\nWhen we studied inorganic molecular configuration, my teacher explained it from the\naspect of electrons with valence bond theory, which was well beyond the level of typical\nhigh school teaching. Similarly, when it came to chemical equilibrium, he liked to use\nformulas and apply his knowledge of thermodynamics. Ultimately, it was such an\napproach that made me appreciate the charm and magic of chemistry. As a result, I\nchose to major in chemistry at Fudan University, and studied hard to acquire much more\nknowledge about this field.\nBased on the foundational knowledge gained from my classes at Fudan University, I\nwas part of a group that began to conduct research into functional polymer. The project\naimed to synthesize some new types of polymers, to resolve certain problems, with a\nview to putting them to practical industrial use in the future due to the promise offered\nby their outstanding electricity performance. During this experience, I was responsible\nfor the organic precursor synthesis for polymerization. The main problem I had was\nfinding the optimal conditions to enhance productivity, especially since the initial\nproductivity level was only about 20%. To improve this I decided to approach it from\ntwo perspectives. One of these involved improving my technical skills in the synthesis\nprocess, such as wiping out oxygen and water, as well as working on column\nchromatography purification, which turned out to be very effective as the productivity\nrose to around 40%. The other approach entailed optimizing reaction conditions, but as\nthe reaction process included several steps, it was a real challenge to be precise with\nfinding the key point. Inspired by what I had learned from the course, I thought the\nGrignard reagent might play a more important role in the reaction, so I began optimizing\nreaction parameters, such as the ratio, the temperature, and the adding rate of the\nGrignard reagent in this process. However, the experiments didn’t always go as planned,\nand when extracting and condensing some white substances appeared. Through H-\nNMR, I discovered that it was the remains of the pinacol, one of the reagents. To resolve\nthis issue, water was added to the system to dissolve the pinacol, and then diethyl ether\nwas used to extract the target product. I’m very pleased to say that the results drew\npraise from the professor. This experience enabled me to obtain a good grasp of basic\nexperimental skills and enabled me to tackle the problems I encountered during\nexperiments. Meanwhile, I recognized that there are various obstacles and challenges\nwhen undertaking scientific research, which demand huge amounts of efforts and hard\nwork, meaning that I have to maintain a consistently positive attitude when\nencountering such difficulties.\nI continued with the work of flow polymerization and wrote a review on computer-\naided flow polymerization. First, we carried out a comprehensive exposition on flow\npolymerization, combined with computers and algorithms. This serves to address the\ngap in this field to some extent, as computer technology is novel in polymerization.\n10/07/2024 09:54 Personal Statement 1/3",

Thereafter, the most recent research into the flow polymerization based\non computers were incorporated and divided into four sections: high-throughput living\npolymerizations in flow; programmable regulations of dispersity profile; sequence and\ntopology for polymers modular design with online monitoring; and self-optimized\nliving polymerizations in flow.\nThis work on polymers and flow synthesis led me to chemical synthesis with algorithm\nand computer technology, which impressed me greatly. During my studies in chemistry,\nand my work in polymer science within the laboratory, I firmly believe that I have been\nequipped with an excellent level of knowledge in chemistry and material science, and\nhave also fostered a series of experimental skills, which have encouraged me to keep\nprogressing in the field of scientific research. When studying in Columbia University,\nI joined Yang’s group and learned a lot about the polymer electrolyte, K-S battery and\nbattery cycle test in the first semester. After that I joined Steingart’s group, taking\ncharge of the program on lithium recycling from NMC811 powder, while I also\nparticipated in the program on recycling metallic hydroxides from batteries into a\nsodium-ion battery cathode precursor. I successfully recycled lithium from NMC811\npowder with bromine at over 90% efficiency, without leaching out any other metals,\nincluding cobalt, nickel and manganese. The same experiment condition was carried\nout on LFP powder, and a similar result was achieved. Controlled experiments were\ncarried out with sulfuric acid system and sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide (piranha)\nsystem, and the bromine system showed great selectivity and reaction efficiency over\nlithium. Due to my curiosity about the composition of the residues after leaching, XRD,\nSEM and EDS were utilized to confirm both the element composition and structure of\nthe solid. In addition to studying experimental skills and the many characterization\ntechniques, I also developed the ability to solve the problems I have encountered in the\nscientific research process like the balance between feeding pop density and reaction\nrate, the separation of liquid-solid phase with the presence of bromine, and unusual\ncolor change during the reaction. The solution appeared magenta only in the reaction\nof residues with sulfuric acid after bromine leaching, while the samples taken at\ndifferent timepoints during the reaction turned brown and precipitated overnight.\nFollowing time spent reading a range of other papers, I figured out what had happened\nto this system based on the ICP and EDS data.\nAfter several years’ work in the lab, I firmly believe that I am equipped with the\nenthusiasm, recognition and necessary professional skills to continue my journey in the\nfield of scientific research. I am really interested in polymer and battery, which I think\nhas been, and will always be, of great importance in society, and I hope that I am able\nto make even some small achievements within these fields. I am very hopeful that I can\njoin Columbia’s PhD program to keep chasing my dream, especially as Columbia is\nmaking great advancements in the field of energy, offering me the very best stage for\n10/07/2024 09:54 Personal Statement 2/3",

Furthermore, I have been working in CEEC and Dan’s group for quite a\nwhile, meaning that I am familiar with the work and instruments in Chemical\nEngineering. I have also made many friends with other PhD students in Chemical\nEngineering, and we have offered one other a lot of help as we have pursued our\nresearch. As I look to the future, I sincerely hope I can keep studying and working in\nColumbia’s Chemical Engineering department.\n10/07/2024 09:54 Personal Statement 3/3",
