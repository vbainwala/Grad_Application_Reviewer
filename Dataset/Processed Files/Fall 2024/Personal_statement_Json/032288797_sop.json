I felt delighted to be accepted to my dream school, but\nI also felt pressure. I knew it must be a difficult process, and I was worried that I would not be able\nto overcome these challenges. The admitted students were all outstanding, and I doubted my\nqualification to study and compete with them. But very soon, I turned this pressure into motivation.\nAt the end of the orientation day, I stood under the Alma Mater statue, appreciating the beautiful\ncampus under the golden sunset, with one ambitious fantasy in my mind — becoming a PhD\nstudent at Columbia. Now, as I enter the last semester of my MS degree, I feel confident that I will\nsucceed as a PhD student in a research group at Columbia.\nI received my Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from University at Buffalo,\nSUNY in 2022. In my undergraduate, I took fundamental courses in chemistry and chemical\nengineering, which provided me with basic knowledge for doing research. I also mastered how to\nuse MATLAB and Python as tools for data analysis. My first research experience as an\nundergraduate was with Dr. Kun Zheng’s group at the Institute of Chemistry Chinese Academy of\nSciences for summer research. Dr. Zheng’s research focuses on designing materials with high\nthermal performance. I participated in the project to enhance the interfacial thermal conductance\nof epoxy and alumina composite interfaces. I co-authored one article on this research in Journal\nof Physics: Conference Series. My next project involved the synthesis of boron nitride nanosheet\n(BNNS) polymer composites with high out-of-plane thermal conductivities. I put my effort into\ndoing literature reviews, experimental scheme formulation, and the compilation and sorting of\narticles. The experience from that summer was my first introduction to scientific research. Due to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, I was unable to be present in the lab to hold reactions and characterize\nsamples by hand. This sparked my eagerness and curiosity about the synthesis and characterization\nof those materials in the laboratory setting.\nProf. Sanat Kumar provided me with an opportunity to satisfy this desire and curiosity. I\njoined his research group in the first semester in Columbia, guided by a PhD student who is my\nmentor. The first project I participated in was the synthesis polymer-grafted nanoparticles (GNP)\nvia surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). I learned the fundamentals\nof ATRP with my mentor and started a series of experiments. Besides reading articles and taking\npart in the design of the experiment, I gained valuable experience in ATRP synthesis, and using\nmultiple instruments like TGA, GPC, DLS, SAXS, and glove box to characterize the grafted\nnanoparticle materials. After collecting and analyzing the data, we discussed them with Prof.\nKumar during the weekly project meeting and listened to his guidance and suggestions. I focus\nmy contribution on the synthesis and characterization of different GNP samples. A key material\nparameter is the particle grafting density, i.e., the number of chains connected to the particle. To\nmeasure the grafting density of these particles, I carried a series of polymer-chain cleaving\nreactions with tetra-n-butylammonium fluoride (TBAF) and characterized the molecular weight\ndistributions of the polymer chains via gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Besides knowing\nthe molecular weight distributions, I also found a small excess of TBAF is enough to cleave the\nchains from the particle surface and that a large excess of TBAF will break the poly (methyl\nacrylate) chains. These findings pushed the project forward. Participating in the weekly group\nmeetings is another component of my master’s research. I had the fortune to give one research\n10/07/2024 09:54 Personal Statement 1/2",

I practiced my speech with concentration, trying to find the clearest\nway to explain my research content. I presented with enthusiasm during the group meeting,\nreporting my work to my peers and letting them feel how familiar I am with my research topic.\nAt the beginning of this summer, my mentor decided to start another project with me. This\nproject is aiming to make anion exchange membranes with quaternized amine fixed charges.\nThis project is a part of an ongoing collaboration with Prof. Ngai Yin Yip’s in Earth and\nEnvironmental Engineering. Thanks to my previous experience of conducting ATRP synthesis, it\nis easy for me to synthesize the co-polymers and characterize them using GPC. In the future, I\nplan to use H-NMR to identify the chemical species and their composition in the copolymers.\nThe coursework at Columbia provides me with a broader perspective of chemical\nengineering. I took Prof. Alexander Urban’s atomistic simulations course in the second semester\nand performed well. In this course, we were introduced to simulation and computation methods\nfor predicting the structure and properties of materials, such as Lennard-Jones potential, Density\nfunctional theory, Monte Carlo simulation, and Radial Distribution Function. By doing the course\nprojects, I saw how these abstract theories can be concretized with data and figures. I realized that\nsimulation is a powerful approach for developing new materials besides laboratory work.\nAdditionally, I took Prof. Daniel Esposito’s kinetic course in the same semester. In his course, I\nlearned how to predict the reaction rate and design a reactor by reaction conditions. I also learned\nthe principles of surface reaction (Langmuir isotherm and BET isotherm) and collision theories.\nI believe these will benefit my future research a lot.\nBoth my undergraduate and graduate research experience make me interested in soft matter,\npolymers, nanoparticles, and composite materials. In the future, I want to learn and research more\nabout their synthesis, characterization, and applications. I also want to know more about surface\nchemistry and surface structure for materials and make them be used as fillers, membranes,\nelectrodes, or catalysts. To achieve the target above, I would like to use both laboratory and\ncomputation skills.\nAfter these years of study and research, I start to realize what scientific research is: it is not\nonly working hard to master synthesis techniques and instrument operations for pursuing\nexperiment results fitting the expectation. It is more like a pursuit of knowledge and truth. Accept\nan experimental result even if the results may be far from what I want. Try to use the knowledge\nto explain these results. Share your results with your colleagues and learn from them. Read\nliterature to see if others have measured similar results. Find possible flaws in the experiment.\nIterate this process until you make progress. Hard work is the character that a master's student who\nis new to scientific research should possess, most of us applicants have had it. The ability to\nconduct independent research may be rare among us, and it is an indispensable quality of a doctoral\nstudent. I think, luckily, under the guidance of professors and my mentor, I have initially developed\nthe ability to independently engage in scientific research and cultivated this quality. Conducting\nresearch and problem-solving have both become parts of my life. I am eager to investigate more\nnew knowledge in the future with faculty members at Columbia and to make my own contribution\nto the field. I believe my research experience, skills, and qualities can make me a successful PhD\nstudent in Columbia Chemical Engineering.\nNow, I put my hands off the keyboard, and I leave my desk. Again, standing in front of the\nAlma Mater statue, gazing at the campus bathed in autumn sunlight, a warm feeling rises in my\nheart.\n10/07/2024 09:54 Personal Statement 2/2",
