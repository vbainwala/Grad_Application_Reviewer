Smallchemicalcompoundsarealsothemostcommonlyemployedclassof\ndrug used to modulate protein function. More advanced models for predicting protein-ligand interactions\nare therefore needed to fully leverage the power of current machine learning methods for drug discovery\nagainst novel targets. In addition, the recent success in protein structure prediction has been followed\nby significant advancements in generative modelling of entirely new protein structures. Models incorpo-\nrating cutting-edge research from geometric deep learning and natural language processing have already\nshown promising success for designing proteins with desired features, yet there is still a lot of potential for\npushing the frontier. Combining a background in Biochemistry with more than 2.5 years of computational\nresearch experience, I believe I am ideally suited to tackle such research questions. As a PhD student in\nthe Columbia Computer Science program, I therefore plan to focus on developing novel machine learning\nmethodsforpredictingmolecularinteractionsanddesigningnewproteinswithtailoredproperties.\nMyundergraduatestudieshavegivenmeafundamentalunderstandingoftheproblemsIamnowtry-\ning to solve with machine learning. After graduating high school as best student in my year with an award\nfromtheGermanChemicalSociety,IjoinedtheprestigiousBiochemistryprogramatHeidelbergUniversity\nas one of only 25 selected students, where I learned about the inner workings of proteins and molecular\ncausesofdiseases. InmyfirstresearchprojectinProfessorMaikeBublitz’sgroupattheUniversityofOx-\nford, I used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a membrane protein in complex with novel\ninhibitors.
