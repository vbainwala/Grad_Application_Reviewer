      "content": "Growing up, I found joy in connecting disparate ideas to form new insights around how people think,\nwhich eventually led me to the U.S. for college. I had long been drawn to psychology, but my perspective\nwidened when I encountered cognitive science through the lens of artificial intelligence when reading\nabout AlphaZero in 2018. This moment revealed to me that complex reasoning could extend beyond\nhumans, opening fascinating questions about the parallels and limitations of human and artificial\nintelligence.\nAt Williams College, I immersed myself in cognitive science, computer science, and complexity theory to\nunderstand the connections between human cognition and AI. As I explored deeper, it became apparent\nto me that to understand human cognition computationally I would need to learn more neuroscience.\nSoon into my journey, while taking a class on the neuroscience of learning in late 2021, I became aware\nof people’s worries surrounding AI. It was at this point I shifted from simply having an intellectual curiosity\nin these topics to caring about ensuring the safe development of AI and the equitable cognitive\nempowerment of people.\nI had inconsistent grades at Williams College, which I eventually discovered was due to mild Autism and\nhave since found that with basic accommodations I am no longer held back by it, as evidenced by my\nresearch productivity. This, combined with The Williams Curve (1-2 As per class), meant I only got a GPA\nof 3.1 (even worse, I got 2.99 because I forgot to remove a class I dropped).\nSince graduating from Williams College, I have been working at the Carney Institute for Brain Science at\nBrown initially under Professor Sebastian Musslick, and now under Professor Michael J. Frank. In those\n2.5 years, I was able to get extensive experience in research across a range of disciplines, ranging from\nclosed loop behavioral research design to reinforcement learning, presenting at 5\nconferences/workshops, publishing 6 peer-reviewed papers, with 3 more currently under review, (and 2\nmore nearing completion), with a total of 5 (+2) as lead author. In that time my team won first place in the\nCarney Institute’s Brainstorm Modeling Challenge and the 2nd Annual Brainstorm Challenge.",

      "content": "During the pandemic, I also explored complexity science through courses at the Santa Fe Institute,\nstudying emergence and agent-based modeling. This multidisciplinary lens helped me understand\ncognition as an emergent property of neural computations, especially when applied to large-scale\nsystems like LLMs and the brain. This reinforced my view that cognition extended beyond reductionism,\nrequiring insights from nondeterministic approaches to be computationally modeled.\nThrough all this, I came to appreciate how difficult it was to reverse engineer the brain from neural\nsignals, how important computational modeling is in creating testable hypotheses about human cognition,\nand how remarkably emergent human and machine cognitive capabilities are. Combined with the\nrealization of just how fast AI was developing, I concluded that the most efficient path to understanding\nand harnessing cognition would involve mapping the architectural and algorithmic biases of the brain onto\nmachine learning models across a wide range of scales. I believe such an approach addresses the\nemergent nature of cognition, allowing us to explain cognitive capabilities that arguably emerge from\nprocesses that arise as the model scale increases. I also believe this allows us to apply knowledge from\nsocial psychology and neuroscience–about how prosocial behavior arises and operates–to the AI models\nthat are becoming increasingly autonomous. And finally, I believe this allows us to better translate\nbetween AI and human cognition, so that the technology currently being developed can more seamlessly\nfit with how we think and what we value.\nI am currently exploring this by determining whether social and emotional reasoning can be enhanced by\nexplicitly disentangling computations related to sensory processing and decision-making. My research\nplan is to implement, test, and continue developing a cognitively-inspired transformer model that makes a\nfirst attempt at this by separating heads that are trained using reinforcement learning from those trained\nwith next token prediction, while allowing heads in both groups to access the layer-wise outputs of the\nother. I have written a preprint that goes into more detail about this. My research goals are still in their\nearly stages, and I expect them to change as I learn from and adapt to my next research lab.",

      "content": "I was struck by the interdisciplinary focus and leading faculty in socially aware and human-centered AI at\nColumbia, which aligns well with my goals to develop cognitively inspired AI systems that understand and\nengage empathetically with humans. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with Professor\nZhou Yu, whose expertise in designing intelligent interactive systems that blend multimodal sensing with\nsocially-aware AI aligns perfectly with my interest in creating AI that engages naturally and empathetically\nwith humans. Her focus on non-verbal behaviors and conversational AI complements my vision of\nsocially-aligned cognitive systems. Furthermore, I am inspired by Professor Jeannette Wing’s dedication\nto developing trustworthy AI, as her emphasis on robustness, fairness, and interpretability directly\nintersects with my commitment to designing AI that is safe, reliable, and values-driven. Columbia’s strong\nemphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration and its leadership in advancing both technical and societal\ndimensions of AI make it an ideal environment for me to grow as a researcher and contribute\nmeaningfully to the field.\nAlongside my research, I have also founded CyberKind, an advocacy group focused on the development\nof compassionate AI and the equitable empowerment of people through AI and neurotechnology. I\nenvision Columbia as a place where my academic work will not only advance my research goals but also\nstrengthen my ability to do this advocacy work.\nMy long-term vision is to foster a symbiotic relationship between humans and AI, where both benefit and\ngrow together. I aspire to help develop AI systems that can understand and empathize with humans, with\nthe hope that this will help with value alignment. I plan to apply my research to benefit both academia and\nbroader society, developing technologies that empower individuals and foster a collaborative future\nbetween humans and AI. I am excited by the prospect of engaging with the collaborative and\ninterdisciplinary environment at Columbia, as I believe it is the ideal setting to grow as a researcher and\nadvocate for a kinder, fairer future.",
