Used Grad-CAM and\nGuided Backpropagation to visualize model decision-making processes, enhancing\ninterpretability of classification results.\n2D Transformer-Based Model Adaptation\nExplored adapting 2D Transformer models pre-trained on ImageNet for 3D image segmentation\ntasks using weight inflation to retain depth information. Implemented various weight\ninflation strategies, including center, average, and random inflation, enabling effective\ntransfer learning while preserving spatial depth cues.\nTraffic Sign Recognition\nImplemented a real-time pipeline for traffic sign recognition using traditional computer\nvision techniques. The pipeline includes segmentation with normalized RGB thresholding for\nextracting regions of interest, detection using a Viola-Jones classifier with Haar-like\nfeatures and AdaBoost, and classification via a Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on HOG\nfeatures. This multi-stage approach enables accurate and efficient traffic sign labeling in\nimages.\nDistributed Fault-Tolerant Key/Value Store\nImplemented the Multi-Paxos algorithm with role collapsing, adapted from \"Paxos Made\nModerately Complex,\" to ensure robust fault tolerance in distributed systems. Key sharding,\nmanaged by a Shard Master, was employed to maximize parallelism and throughput, supporting\ndynamic shard allocations for join, leave, and migration requests. Paxos consensus ensures\nsystem reliability even during network partitions and replica failures, while multi-key\noperations like multi-get, multi-put, and swaps enhance flexibility in distributed\ntransactions.",

      "content": "My initial intrigue with computers began when I discovered the command line on my Mac and\nencountered the raw power of Unix commands for the first time. Unlike the familiar world of user\ninterfaces and drag-and-drop controls, this experience felt uniquely hands-on, opening up a new\ndimension of computing that went beyond what I thought computers were capable of—it felt both\nempowering and cool. As I delved deeper, I found that many of the applications I was beginning to rely\non were supported by a vibrant, global community dedicated to open-source projects like GNU and the\nApache Software Foundation. Witnessing such passionate collaboration aimed at creating resources for\nthe greater good inspired me to explore computing more deeply and to build a greater appreciation for the\nprinciples and practices behind it.\nBuilding on this initial intrigue, I pursued an undergraduate degree in Computer Science. Despite the\nturbulence and uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, I maintained connections with my professors\nthrough emails, virtual office hours, and labs. These interactions provided a strong foundation in the\nmaterial and gave me the confidence to accelerate my studies, ultimately enabling me to graduate a year\nearly.\nAlongside my undergraduate studies, I worked full-time as a software developer at a startup, where my\nrole evolved from supporting smaller projects to developing interactive web applications and backend\nmicroservices. This hands-on experience allowed me to bridge theory and practice, applying classroom\nconcepts to real-world solutions. When remote work became necessary, the time I previously spent\ncommuting was redirected into focused efforts on skill-building and balancing my academic and\nprofessional commitments. This experience honed my time management skills, enhanced my productivity,\nand prepared me for the demanding pace of graduate studies.\nIn my final undergraduate year, I joined UnitedHealth Group (UHG), where I contributed to the\ndevelopment of a modern Medicare Claims Processing System as part of a large, multidisciplinary team.\nWorking within a larger organization allowed me to explore the healthcare sector firsthand and understand\nhow technological solutions are tailored to meet its dynamic needs. Collaborating closely with\ndevelopers, managers, architects, and business stakeholders gave me insight into how each role\ncontributes to a project’s success and helped me identify where my own contributions fit within this\nstructure. For the first time, I saw my work implemented in production, directly impacting millions of\nreal-world users—a rewarding experience that underscored the impact of clear communication, effective\nteamwork, and proactive learning.\nPursuing a Master’s in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning provided me with a\nthorough grounding in the field’s evolution—from early models reliant on hand-engineered features to",

      "content": "deep learning neural networks, and now to the increasingly popular attention-based models. Through this\nprogram’s coursework and projects, I developed a strong understanding of how each generation of models\nbuilds on prior advancements, expanding the capabilities of machine learning. The experience also\nintroduced me to the process of research itself, where I learned to critically engage with academic papers,\ndesign experiments, and appreciate the rigor required to advance knowledge in the field.\nReflecting on my journey, I am deeply grateful to the professors and colleagues who have supported my\ngrowth along the way. Thanks to their guidance, I am now building applications and models that I could\nhave only dreamed of back when I first explored the terminal’s potential. I look forward to continuing this\npassion in my PhD studies and ultimately contributing to the global community through impactful\nresearch and innovation.",
