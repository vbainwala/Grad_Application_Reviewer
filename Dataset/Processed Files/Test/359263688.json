      "content": "I am driven to pursue a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to investigate ways in\nwhich different technologies can aid people in improving their own health and wellbeing or\naugment their capabilities, whether through context-aware and ubiquitous computing, AI/ML, or\nphysical and tangible computing. I am applying to the Computer Science PhD program of the Fu\nFoundation School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) at Columbia University to work\nwith leading experts in the field of HCI.\nResearch Interests. I believe that the Columbia SEAS’s emphasis on advancing the role of\ncomputing in our lives through research aligns perfectly with my passion to build the\ntechnologies that benefit humankind.\nI would love to further pursue my current research direction under Dr. Orson Xu in his SEA\nLab. His work on interventions to remedy smartphone overuse presented in papers like\nTime2Stop, MindShift, and TypeOut appeal to me a great deal. I am also inspired by Dr. Xu’s\nwork in areas of large language models for health prediction and efficient communication\nbetween patients and providers in healthcare.\nI believe Dr. Xu’s research aligns perfectly with my interests and experience. My own\nexperiences and those of my peers led me to a deep dive on HCI papers combatting digital\ndistraction, and immediately, I was hooked on the idea of behavioral interventions promoting\nwellbeing. I developed FocuShift, a shape-changing phone case-attached device, as a tangible\nintervention to combat smartphone overuse. An Android app was also designed to trigger the\nshape-change intervention based on screen time. FocuShift is a tangible alternative to some\nexisting anti-distraction apps (e.g., One Sec, Opal) that are easy to be dismissed and ignored, and\nothers that fully block distracting apps and remove the user agency essential to developing self-\nawareness, self-moderation and habit formation.\nA 48 hour in-the-wild study comparing screen time between baseline phone usage and\nphone usage with the shape-changing intervention was conducted, which showed a significant\n39.7% reduction in distracting app usage across all participants. A qualitative analysis revealed\nthat all participants found the ergonomic intervention enhanced their awareness of phone use,\nand successfully redirected their attention toward healthier and more productive tasks (e.g.,\nreading a book as opposed to scrolling on social media). The significance of the study affirmed\nmy desire to explore novel ways in which technologies such as AI and context-aware devices\nand systems can monitor user behavior and intervene when necessary to assist users in improving\ntheir own lives. A paper on the study has been submitted for review at CHI 2025.\nWorking with Dr. Brian Smith as part of the Computer-Enabled Abilities Lab (CEAL)\nwould also be a great way to satisfy my research desires. I would love to explore ways in which\nemerging technologies like computer vision and AR can be leveraged to extend people’s\ncapabilities and make them more productive and involved agents in the world as a way of\npromoting overall wellbeing. His work on StreetNav and Surveyor are particularly inspiring to\nme as efforts to empower blind and low-vision individuals to experience the world more fully,\nleading to increased safety and access to entertainment respectively.\nI am also inspired by Dr. Xia Zhou’s work in employing light as a medium for sensing\nbehaviors and objects, specifically her work on a noninvasive glucose monitoring device using\n1",

      "content": "light, which coincides closely with my interest in health monitoring using mobile devices such as\nwearables and smartphones.\nMy interest in HCI first took shape when I worked on a multi-robot control system in my\njunior year, named “Zorozoro”, under Dr. Ken Nakagaki in the AxLab at the University of\nChicago (UChicago). Zorozoro controls “Toio” robots developed by Sony. I expanded the\nhardware to control more robots and implemented more advanced robot movement functions\nthrough Rust and Processing code. I then worked on Threading Space, which utilized up to ten\npairs of Toio robots and explored the transformation of spatial perception by reconfiguring the\nrobots’ collective animation. A grid-based path planning algorithm was employed to allow for\nseamless transitions. This development resulted in a 5-day exhibition in Linz, Austria and a\nconference publication at C&C 2024.\nEarly Encounters with STEM. I did not fall in love with STEM intentionally. I was placed\nin Kumon for after-school learning in math at an early age. I learned to love the subject through\nthe fulfilment of becoming one of a select few who reached the level of calculus while in middle\nschool. With inflated confidence, I joined the UC Berkely Math Circle, where I was force-fed the\nreality that I was not, in fact, the smartest in the world. In a room full of young math geniuses, I\nstrove to become one of them. I first became acquainted with computer science in high school,\nwhen I registered for concurrent enrollment in a local community college. My first class was in\nC++, a challenging language for a young beginner. I saw hours of hard work and debugging on\nmy final project manifest a fully functional Sudoku game onto my computer screen. The ability\nto create with just a keyboard and my brain is what drew me into the world of computer science.\nI now seek to share the benefits I reaped from the opportunities I had with others.\nSTEM Outreach. During the summer of 2023, a UChicago mathematics professor was\nteaching a class to K-12 Chicago Public School teachers on an effective method of teaching\nmathematics under the Polk Bros Foundation, an organization dedicated to Chicago’s\ncommunities most affected by poverty and inequity. I was honored to be his teaching assistant\n(TA) and hoped to make a positive impact. I taught and met with these teachers four times a\nweek throughout the summer to lead and guide discussions of effective strategies of teaching\nmathematics in early education. By the end of summer, most of them mastered the skills that we\ntaught and were eager to apply them to their students.\nLeadership & Community Building. In my freshman year, I coordinated with some of my\nfriends and co-founded the UChicago Robotics Club RSO (recognized student organization).\nThrough the peak of COVID-19 and the years thereafter, I co-chaired the club and recruited over\n40 active members. I secured the funding required to build our first full-sized battle robots by our\nsecond year. I led the club to enter UIUC’s Robobrawl competition two years in a row and win\nfirst place at Harvard’s MakeHarvard makeathon. My club hosted numerous robotics workshops\nfor middle school and high school students in the Chicago Public Schools system and received\nthe Outstanding New RSO Award and the Organization of the Year award from UChicago,\nhonoring our commitment to community outreach and leadership in the field.\nI sincerely hope to make a meaningful contribution to human-centric research in either an\nacademic setting or industry in the future, equipped with the expertise and experience that I stand\nto gain from the Computer Science PhD program of SEAS at Columbia.\n2",
