It meshesbothof\nmy priorityresearch areas, AI,network, andmachinelearning, aswell ascourses Iwish Icould\nhavetaken asanundergraduate.Havingthe opportunitytonow try thesecoursesexcites medue\nto the knowledgeI wouldgainand thepotential pathwaysthat may beunlocked fromthese\ncourses,suchascybersecurity.Thecourses withinthe areaofAI &Applications,for example,\nwouldbe anewand excitingexperience,allowing meto pursuemypassions.Other coursesfrom\ntheSystemsand Theory area wouldalsobe helpfulfor myfuture projectsincludingusing\ntransformer modelstoidentify andclassifydiseases withsymptoms efficiently.Iam already\ncurrentlyin GATech’sDPL(Decision ProcessLab)researching anefficientmethod of\nclassifying diseaseswith symptoms usingPython andwish toexpanduponthat.\nI hope towork onan AI-relatedproject for mythesisthat analyzeshow humans identify\ndiseases basedonsymptoms. Thistopic builds onmycurrent projectwithProfessorThomas. My\ncurrent researchclassifies diseases basedonsymptoms, andwiththe helpof AI,couldeventually\nresultin diseasesbeingidentifiedfasteror discoveringcorrelations between symptomsand\ndiseases notdiscovered before.This wouldhaveabeneficial impactonnotonlythe futureof\nmedicinebut oneveryoneinthe worldwho is sickand needsfaster, moreaccessiblemedical\nattention.Architectures from cognitivesciencecan beeffectively leveragedfor AI, offeringthe\ndistinctadvantage of being morehuman-readable comparedtomany transformer-basedsystems.\nFurthermore, myresearch inthe DecisionProcessesLaboratory (DPL)explores search\ntermination decisions—acriticalconsideration for bothhumans andAI.Any decision-making\nentitymust determinewhen continuingasearch islessproductive thanstopping andmaking a\ndecision underthecurrentstate ofuncertainty. Consequently,modelsthat encapsulatehuman\nreasoningand intelligencehave thepotential tobothinform andenhanceAIsystems.\nBesides AI,I also want toworkonacybersecurity project againstphishing emails.I\nwouldgather phishingscamsfrom thepast andpresent toextract specificfeatures,including\nURLs, subjects,etc.I wouldthen useamodel, like atransformermodel, toidentify keyfeatures\nthat phishingscams share,andthen comparethe keyfeaturesbetween the pastand currentscams\nto seetheir evolutionandfigure outthe patternor newmethod thatallows them tobypass the\ncurrent securitymeasures. Iwouldthen workoncodethat combatsthe current phishingscams\nand codethatcouldhandle futurescams.\nSuchresearch incybersecurityand medicinealignswithmy goalsof usingAI toaddress\nlocaland globalcrises. Withmybackgroundin datamining andmachine learning,I hopeto\ndevelop innovativesolutionsto advancethefields andcreate ameaningful differenceinpeople’s\nlives.\nI was theleaderofour teaminmySoftware Engineeringcourse.Ourterm project\nconsistedof creating amovie bookingwebsite,encompassing userfeaturessuch aschecking\ncurrentlyavailable movies, buyingtickets, andbookingseats.There were also severalother\nrequirements, suchasalogin systemfor ticketbuyers.Theproject wassplitintomultiple parts,\neach dueona specificdate.\nI organized everycomponent ofthe websiteandassignedthem tomy teammateswho\nvaried inskills, fromnetwork programming tosystemanalysis; I ensuredthat eachmember\nreceived theproperpart.I checkedthat all workwasdonetwodays beforethe duedate then\ntested anddebuggedany unexpected errors.Withthis system,wenevermissedadue dateand\nhad norushwith handlingissues.I announced everyduedate andnoticetokeep myteammates\nontrack andconfirmedeveryone wasmaking progress byrequiringthem torecord workfor the\nday.Of course,not everyoneworked everyday,soIwas understandingand keptit professional.",
