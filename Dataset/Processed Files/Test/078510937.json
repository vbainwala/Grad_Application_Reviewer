When a new list of items is requested to be packed in an RSP, it takes\nweeks to distribute and pack these items among multiple bins.\n· Project Goals: Optimize RSP packing process by minimizing the packing time and the number of required bins. The inputs\nare a list of boxes including dimensions and weights while the target output is the assignment of each item to a position and\norientation within a bin.\nMethods and Conclusions\n· Developed offline 3D multi-bin packing algorithms for use with multiple bin types, shelf configurations, as well as weight and\ncenter of gravity constraints\n· Conducted literature review of conventional and state-of-the-art approaches for bin packing\n· Appliedmultiplealgorithmicapproachesincludingsatisfiabilitymodulotheoryformulations,mixedintegerprogramformulations,\nand deep reinforcement learning based approaches\n· Ultimately employed greedy heuristic-based methods due to the project’s need for speed, determinism, and adaptability to\ncurrent and future constraints\n· Implemented a 3D rendering environment for visualizing and interacting with bin-packing solutions\n· Solution ran in less than 5 seconds and demonstrated close to 80% packing efficiency with respect to performance metrics\nincluding spatial and weight utilization\nSolar Extreme Ultraviolet Prediction University of Hawai‘i at Ma¯noa\nCaltech/UH, Samuel P. and Frances Krown SURF Fellowship\n· Background: Stars absorb and emit radiation across a broad spectrum observable through ground observatories and satellite\nimagery. Estimations of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) emissions aid in understanding stellar system dynamics, yet this radiation\nis blocked by interstellar medium. Unlike other stars, our sun provides observable EUV emissions and suitable proxy data.\n· Project Goals: Predict pixel-wise solar EUV emissions using a ground observable Helium I absorption line as a proxy.\nMethods and Conclusions\n· Constructed a labeled dataset by pairing solar images of different wavelengths from the SOLIS facility and the SDO spacecraft\n· Createdphysics-informeddeepneuralnetworksbyaddingradialdistanceandsolarlatitudeasinputfeaturechannelstoaccount\nfor spherical projection of solar images and equatorial emission patterns\n· Compared the prediction accuracy of different deep network architectures such as U-Net and FCN\n· Concluded that convolutional models achieved the lowest relative error, beating out non-spatial models\n· ResultsagreewithexistingliteratureindicatingthatHeIabsorptioncontributestoEUVemissionandthatsurfacesolarfeatures\nmay invert the typical correlation\n· Presented results at PGAI-AAAI ’20 and published them in The Astrophysical Journal Letters",
