      "content": "Lacey Rose DeLucia Columbia SoP\nHow can we disincentivize companies from returning manipulated data in black box\naudits of AI fairness? From the returned data, what level of confidence can we have in our\nfindings? Motivated by these questions my current research focuses on designing a sequential\ntest audit for AI models through the lens and machinery of election auditing. In this framework,\nI am working on balancing factors of data manipulation, maintaining a low false positive rate,\nprivacy costs of a company sharing data, and efficiency. If I can encompass the many caveats of\nthe auditing process, I hope that this project can impact policies for addressing fairness in AI. At\nColumbia, I wish to continue researching areas of algorithmic fairness so that I can\ncontribute towards AI accountability and responsibility.\nWorking hands-on with large, noisy, real-world datasets with Dr. Sebastian Caldas at\nPrinceton was my window into applying machine learning to tangible problems. As my\nindependent work, I devised my own project to train transformer models including BERT-CNN,\nBERT-BiLSTM, along with a baseline for binary detection of depression in Reddit data. The\nfuture of classifiers like these is to develop unsupervised methods to identify mental health\nissues, but previous studies have not analyzed performance on various levels of depression.\nThrough this experience, I learned that finetuning a model is truly an art as weeks of grid search\nwere required to achieve a high F1 score. Even with similar metrics to those of previous work,\nall models detected severe depression at higher rates than moderate depression, illustrating\ndisparity in these deep learning models. It was this experience that showed me I could continue\nto impact people’s lives while focusing on machine learning as a career path.\nAfter my awakening in applied machine learning, I desired to challenge myself with\nproblems that would keep me up at night thinking about open-ended questions, so I pushed the\nboundaries of my research abilities with theoretical machine learning. With Dr. Qi Lei at NYU, I",

      "content": "Lacey Rose DeLucia Columbia SoP\nbuilt on her previous work by extending a multi-task lifelong learning algorithm to a contextual\nbandit setting, an unexplored intersection of topics. Unlike traditional machine learning, lifelong\nlearners take on tasks sequentially and preserve useful knowledge as they go. The goal of the\nalgorithm was to learn a low-rank representation for each task, considering context and focusing\non minimizing samples, as data samples can be costly in real-world settings. With no experience\nin theoretical machine learning, I redid the proofs of similar papers and met weekly with Dr. Lei\nfor her conceptual insight. Eventually, I was able to strategically decide which theorems I needed\nto prove differently and which I could cite. In this way, I was able to prove that the algorithm\nachieved epsilon accuracy with lower sample complexity than other works in the field. While\nthriving at the challenge of these proofs, I realized that even in the theoretical space I wish for\nmy setting to have a more direct impact on society or systems.\nCurrently, for my thesis, I am collaborating with Dr. Lydia Liu at Princeton and UC\nBerkeley graduate student Deborah Raji on building a framework for auditing AI models. In\nthis setting, an auditor must decide on the fairness of a model based on a dataset returned by the\ncompany, but the dataset is likely manipulated. We have tried various approaches to make our\nmodel as realistic as possible. Originally, the goal was to design a contract of potential\nmanipulations and corresponding statistical significance levels. Due to statistical guarantees, our\ncurrent aim is to utilize election auditing tools to design a sequential test audit of AI models.\nFrom a principal-agent perspective, I am working on incorporating a gold standard dataset,\nwhich is collected independently of the audit, to verify the distribution of the requested samples.\nHere, if a company is innocent, then they pass the audit with the least number of samples\nnecessary. Overall, we are striving towards a future where fairness is a consideration with models\nand companies are held accountable otherwise.",

      "content": "Lacey Rose DeLucia Columbia SoP\nI hope to continue pursuing research like this, and Columbia has the optimal environment\nfor me to grow as a researcher and contribute to impactful advancements in algorithmic fairness.\nSpecifically, I would be eager to collaborate with Dr. Elias Bareinboim, Dr. Daniel Hsu, Dr.\nTim Roughgarden. I enjoyed reading Dr. Bareinboim’s paper on “Fairness-Accuracy Trade-\nOffs: A Causal Perspective” as background for my senior thesis and was intrigued by the many\nperspectives and methods to evaluate fairness in AI models. Under Dr. Bareinboim’s guidance, I\ncould extend my research to a more causal inference setting. Similarly, I am eager to work with\nDr. Daniel Hsu and build on his recent research about auditing for subgroup fairness. On the\nother hand, I am also excited to work on research like “Data-Driven Algorithm Design” and\nalgorithmic game theory problems under Dr. Roughgarden. If given the opportunity I will rise to\nthe challenge of their research.\nMoreover, having switched into the computer science major late in sophomore year, I\nhope to continue learning in all aspects while in graduate school. At Columbia, I wish to take Dr.\nRoughgarden’s class Analysis of Algorithms and Machine Learning Theory with Dr. Daniel Hsu.\nSimilarly, serving as a teaching assistant during undergrad has been both a learning experience\nand a rewarding way for me to give back to the computer science community. I will work hard to\nbe an impactful teacher and mentor so that younger students have a strong foundation in\ncomputer science. I believe that Columbia’s environment would allow me to reach my full\npotential as a student, teacher, and researcher as well as prepare me with the skills for a career in\nalgorithm design and fairness research. Overall, it would be a privilege to be a part of\nColumbia’s Computer Science Department with its incredible professors and opportunities.",
