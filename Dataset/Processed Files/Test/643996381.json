His positivity is contagious, and he stays active, living\nwith an energy that defies his age. Yet,despitethisyouthfulspirit,heshowssubtlesignsofagingthatare\nhard to ignore. Small moments, like forgetting whatheateyesterdayorstrugglingtorecallrecentevents,\nserve as reminders of the inevitable changes he faces. My grandmother, now undergoing dialysis in\nThailand, endures long hours of treatment leaving her exhausted in ways that are hard to witness,\nespecially knowing I can’t always be there to help. Theyweremyfirstteachers,instillinginmeessential\nlifeskillsandvaluesthatformedthefoundationofwhoIamtoday.Now,astheirneedsincrease,ourroles\nhave begun to reverse, and I findmyselfwantingtosupporttheminnewways.Thispersonaljourneyhas\ndriven my passion for AI and personalized technology, inspiring me to develop innovations that can\nprovide companionship,medicalsupport,andongoinglearningtailoredtoeachindividual’suniqueneeds.\nI hope to study at Columbia, where I canworkattheforefrontofAItocreatetechnologythathonorsand\nsupportsindividualslikemygrandparents,ensuringtheyneverfeelisolatedintheirlateryears.\nMy journey in research began as a 2024 MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP) intern at the MIT\nMedia Lab’s Personal Robots group, where I worked under the mentorship of Dr. Hae Won Park and\nProfessor Cynthia Breazeal on developing personalized AI for parenting. My project, Learning Parent\nStrategies, trained a model to generate and refine parenting strategies by analyzing the DAMI dataset of\nparent-child interactions. By designing a trajectory inspired by reinforcement learning, the model could\ndifferentiate successful strategies from less effectiveones,storingtheseinsightsinlong-termmemoryfor\nfuture retrieval. Using context-based similarity, it suggested tailored strategies to help parents navigate\nchallenging interactions. This work bridged experiential learning, memory systems, and contextual\nadaptation, demonstrating how AI could be designed to understand and respond to individual human\nneeds.ThisworkiscurrentlyinsubmissiontoCSCW’25asafirstauthorpaper.\nThis foundational work sparked my interest in creating AI systems that adapt and personalize to meet\ndiverse needs, leading me to explore the role of AI in education. As acontinuedresearchassistantinthe\nPersonal Robots group, I organized a workshop to gatherinsightsfromhighschoolstudentsandteachers\non how AI could support learning. This experience deepened my understanding of users' needs through\nqualitative coding and workshop design, directly influencing the development of AI-driven personalized\nlearning applications. ThisresearchisnowinsubmissiontoCHI’25.Inparallel,Icontributedtoaproject\ncalled Hinting, which addressed generating commonsense assertions in story contexts using language\nmodels.Byleveragingprefixpromptingtechniqueswithbothhardandsoftprompts,Iimprovedinference\ncontrol and context alignment. This work, submitted to the ACL Rolling Review, whereIamthesecond\nauthor, marks significant progress in advancing intelligent, responsive educational agents—an essential\npartoverarchinggoaltodevelopAIthatsupportsindividualizedsupport.\nBuilding on these experiences, my interest shifted toward applying personalized AI to medicine, where\nthe stakes of adaptive reasoning and tailored responses are even higher. I am currently leading the\nMedFlow project, a comprehensive dialogue dataset forNEJMcases,whichIwillbedevelopingthrough\nOctober 2025. This dataset aims to simulate real-world physician-patientinteractionstoenhancemedical\nreasoninganddiagnostictrainingwithLLMs.Byestablishingbaselineperformance,definingkeymetrics,\nand structuring a taxonomy of key attributes, MedFlow will support model comparison and highlight\nreasoning challenges in LLMs. Additionally, I am partoftheIllusionsinMedicalAIproject,focusingon",

I am particularly excitedabout\nthe chance to work with Columbia Medical School and affiliated hospitals, where I can build on my\nbackground in natural language processing, personalized learning, and neuroscience to develop AI\ntechnologies tailored to healthcare. Columbia’s leadership in interdisciplinary research will allow me to\ngrow technically and collaborate across fields to address complex challenges, such as designing AI\nsystemsthatimprovehealthcareoutcomesandcreatemeaningfulhuman-AIinteractions.\nAt Columbia, I am drawn to the interdisciplinary research opportunities with faculty such as Dr. Bianca\nDumitrascu, whose work in AI and genomics inspires me to advance our understanding of the human\ngenome and improve patient health and drug delivery. Additionally, Dr. Gamze Gürsoy’s focus on\nmedical data analysis aligns with my goal of developing AI systems for disease diagnosis and enhanced\npatient care. Additionally, Dr. Elham Azizi’s research in biomedical machine learning resonateswithmy\npassion for leveraging technology to address healthcare challenges. Ihopetocreatetoolsthatdeepenour\nunderstandingofhealthandcontributetoimpactfulsolutionsinbiomedicalinformatics.\nI would like to become a Professor and PI in an academic research lab where Icancontinuemyworkat\nthe intersection of AI and language. By pushing the boundaries of what language and AI can achieve\ntogether, I aim to create toolsthatenhanceempathy,connection,andunderstandingacrossdiversehuman\nexperiences.
