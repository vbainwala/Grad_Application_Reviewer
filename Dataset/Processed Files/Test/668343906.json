      "content": "My research interests lie in the current and future capabilities of AR/VR technologies, conducting\nresearch on novel aspects of these technologies. My research motivation is to help drive forward\nimmersive technologies as best as I can, in any way I can. I believe due to the myriad of ways\nthat XR technologies can convey information to users, they can help in the safety, comfort, and\nquality of life of every individual. Through the applications of these technologies, people with\ndisabilities can navigate and take caution to imperceptible threats, first responders can make safer\nand better critical decisions, businesses can demonstrate their capabilities for cheaper, the elderly\ncan have virtual assistants to help with new and unfamiliar technologies, and much more. Given\nthis motivation, I’ve been involved in several research and development projects that demonstrate\nmy desire to work interdisciplinary, to take part in this advancement, and ability to conduct\ncutting edge research; which all contribute to me being a strong Ph.D. candidate. Below, I\nelaborate on my selected projects and relevant achievements...\nCurrently, I am pursuing my masters degree in Computer Sciences at Sabanci University. Under\nthe supervision of Professor Selim Balcisoy, I am developing audio augmented systems to create\nan augmented reality environment by giving audio cues to a user, instead of the visual feedback\nof the more popular AR devices. In my thesis, I am exploring how a realistic sound simulation\nsystem within 3D multi-story buildings can be helpful in navigational tasks for blind users, or\nusers in low-vision environments.\nIn addition to these projects with my professors, I am also designing a MOOC XR usability\ncourse for a European Union project, the Metaverse Academy. Details for this project can be\nfound in the following link: metaverse-academy.tech. The course covers usability methods and\nrules that any developer and designer working on AR and VR applications should know.\nPersonal Research Statement - Bilgehan Cagiltay - MS Sabanci University",

      "content": "These projects showed me how to approach unfamiliar topics and research areas, how to work\nwith big data and the importance of backing up data, as well as the amount of effort that goes into\nXR products.\nPrior to my Masters degree, I received my B.S. from the Computer Science and Engineering\nprogram of Sabanci University, one of Turkey’s top research universities and ranked in the top\n400 universities worldwide (I ranked top 3% among 3 million registered examinees).\nI’ve been involved in several AR/VR development projects during my undergraduate program. I\nwas hired as a freelancer developer for a software company. Using the Unity engine, I developed\nAR projects for the Microsoft Hololens 2 and for smartphones. I helped build an AR phone app\nwhich scanned a car, identified its model, and displayed additional information over the car.\nIn another research project, I implemented the cognitive mental rotation task in a mixed reality\nsetting. I developed it for the Hololens 2 on the Unity engine, utilizing the built-in eye-trackers.\nThe findings from the user study of this system was later presented at AVI 2024 conference,\nItaly.\nFurthermore, In summer 2022, I was a research intern at the University of Wisconsin-Madison,\ncontributing to an AR development project supervised by Professor Kevin Ponto. I developed AR\nmeasurement tools on the Unity engine for a mobile phone that helps measure a room for home\nand business inspections. The findings from the user study of this system was presented as a\nposter paper at ISMAR 2023 conference, Australia.\nAs part of my Human-Computer Interaction class, my team and I conducted a study exploring the\nchanges in users’ attention when they are typing using a physical keyboard versus an AR\nPersonal Research Statement - Bilgehan Cagiltay - MS Sabanci University",

      "content": "keyboard. We used the Tobii Eye Tracker and the built-in eye tracker of the Hololens 2 to track\nuser attention. The AR section of the study was built on the Unity engine. Our paper was\npresented at the IECHCI 2023 conference, Turkey.\nIn parallel to my masters thesis, I have worked on a project where I was responsible for mapping\nthe network structure between github repositories. I had a pivotal role in data collection, data\nsanitization, network construction, and analysis of the network properties of this large social\nstructure. This project was supervised by Professor Onur Varol.\nI would like to join Columbia University and especially work under the supervision of Prof.\nSteven Feiner because their research aligns closely with my academic and professional interests. I\nwas particularly intrigued by their projects on the impact of AR documentation for repair tasks,\nand whether an immersive environment simulating vision impairment would increase the\nsympathy and empathy of a user. I am interested in working in interdisciplinary projects to learn\nfrom and improve myself in various subjects. I aim to contribute to and expand my expertise in a\ncollaborative environment that values cross-disciplinary exploration by joining the Computer\nScience program at Columbia University.\nThroughout my education, I have consistently sought out opportunities to challenge myself and\nbroaden my knowledge. My passion for interdisciplinary studies led me to take courses such as\nCognitive Processes, Mind & Behavior, and Basic Concepts of Physics alongside my CS courses.\nIn addition to taking on challenging coursework in areas like Computer Graphics, where I used\nOpenGL, I also took the initiative to participate in the development of Oculus Quest and\nHololens projects to further my skills in XR technologies. Along the way, I learned to use more\nfundamental tools such as OpenAL, and more high-level tools such as Unity and Unreal engine.\nPersonal Research Statement - Bilgehan Cagiltay - MS Sabanci University",
