      "content": "Daniel Green\nSince childhood, I have been enthralled with the concept of biomedical engineering. As I moved\nthrough grade school, I was exposed to the subjects of genetics, molecular and cell biology and\nso knew at a young age my career calling. During my pursuit of a B.S. in Biomedical\nEngineering at the University of Arkansas I learned of the interdisciplinary nature of the field\nand its role in such subjects as systems biology, biomolecular and tissue engineering, proteomics,\nand disease pathology to name a few. My classwork in these areas alerted me to the need to\ninterpret and manage large volumes of data so I added computer science to my curriculum and\nfound my passion for programming.\nDuring my studies at the University of Arkansas, I had two opportunities for research. I spent\nthree semesters working on plasmid research and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) production and\npurification with Dr. Xianghong Qian and the CATO Springs Research Centre and served as her\nTeaching Assistant for the Biomedical Modelling and Numerical Methods class. Another\nsemester I worked under Dr. Nelson on a bioinformatics project reporting on an unintentional\nDNA sequencing insertions/deletions found in his Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)\nresearch. I had the opportunity to write a search program in python and used MATLAB to\npresent the data to the Biomed department. Post-graduation, I worked at a Mercy hospital in\nArkansas as a Lab Support Tech and at The Jackson Laboratory as a Genotyping Technician\nperforming various molecular biology assays including PCR and DNA sequencing. Other\nmolecular responsibilities included the DNA extractions and verifications of DNA control\nsamples like the B6 mouse. Currently I am employed at the University of Pittsburgh Department\nof Pathology as a Research Tech III in the laboratory of Dr. Evan Delgado. In this position my\ngeneral responsibilities include the following, a variety of immunohistochemistry techniques,\ngenotyping, management of the mouse colonies, and bioinformatics-based analysis. Since\nstarting in August of this year, I have streamlined the genotyping process using my own protocol\nthat reduced the amount of mouse sample, lab waste, and time.\nAdmission into the Computational Biology PhD program within the Department of Computer\nScience at Columbia Engineering would provide me the opportunity to pursue my career goal of\ncreating a product or service that improves the lives of people and expanding our knowledge of\nwithin the field. Columbia’s Computational Biology Group is at the forefront of utilizing and\ndeveloping computational and experimental approaches from the fields of genetics, genomics,\nand systems biology to evolve new tools of analysis to further understand genetic variants within\nspecies, primary human SNP and sequencing data and therefore advance healthcare. I am\ninterested in the software development, biomolecule, and genomics research of Dr. David\nKnowles, Dr. Kenneth Ross, Dr. Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi, and Dr. Mohammed AlQuraishi. I\nbelieve that I bring a solid understanding of molecular biology and techniques, a proven record\nin data analysis and programming, a strong work ethic, and a passion to find answers to new and\nold problems. I also believe that I may be able to bring new ideas and perspective having grown\nup in South Africa. The Computational Biology program in the CS department at Columbia\nwould afford me the opportunity to work with leaders in the field and further pursue my passion.",
