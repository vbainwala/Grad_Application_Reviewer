      "content": "Personal Statement\nJames Kim\nColumbia University biojameskim2002@gmail.com\nBackground\nMy lifelong fascination with technology’s applications to human assistance and healthcare\nhas led me to a deep interest in the dynamic interplay between artificial intelligence (AI)\nand neuroscience. I am captivated by how the brain’s remarkable adaptability and efficiency\ninspire new systems and algorithms, and how those developments, in turn, deepen our\nunderstanding of the brain.\nMy research thus far aims to strengthen this interplay by building more accurate models of\nbrain-behavior relationships, holistically integrating both the brain’s functional and structural\nconnections. At Columbia, I am eager to leverage computational advancements to further this\nexciting feedback loop of discovery: using AI to better understand the brain and subsequently\ndrawing inspiration from the brain to develop more efficient AI algorithms. Through this\niterative approach, I aim to enhance medical applications by refining disease prognosis,\nidentifying reliable biomarkers, improving diagnostic accuracy, and supporting personalized\ntreatment strategies.\nFinding My Research Passions\nMy initial desire to pursue research was fueled by my curiosity to understand how humans\ncan leverage AI to enhance interactions with the environment. This passion led me to study\nwearable sensing systems with Professor Cheng Zhang in Information Science at Cornell\nUniversity, where I focused on using AI to continuously estimate 3D hand poses through\nactive acoustic sensing—the reflection and diffraction of inaudible sound waves.\nTo achieve this, we developed EchoWrist1, a wristband that emits inaudible sound\nwaves towards the hand and captures the resulting echoes to identify various hand poses. I\nspearheaded user studies to optimize microphone and speaker placement and helped train a\ncustom CNN model to deduce hand poses from 20 finger joints. Our work, published in CHI\n’24, honed my ability to conduct independent, in-depth analysis within a research domain.\n1Chi-Jung Lee et al., ”EchoWrist: Continuous Hand Pose Tracking and Hand-Object Interaction Recogni-\ntionUsingLow-PowerActiveAcousticSensingOnaWristband,”CHI ’24: Proceedings of the CHI Conference\non Human Factors in Computing Systems: https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642910\n1",

      "content": "Personal Statement\nJames Kim\nColumbia University biojameskim2002@gmail.com\nBy reviewing pertinent literature, I identified our project’s limitations, distinguished existing\nwristband form factors from novel approaches, and uncovered potential applications.\nWhile I was fascinated with EchoWrist’s potential for monitoring psychiatric disorders\nlike Tourette Syndrome, I sought a more fundamental approach to treating and modulating\nneurologicalconditionsbeforetheironset,ratherthanfocusingsolelyonobservablephenotypes.\nThis curiosity led me to collaborate with Professors Amy Kuceyeski and Mert Sabuncu\nin the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine and ECE at Cornell Tech, where I\nbecame captivated with modeling the brain’s functional and structural connections.\nIn my first project, I built a ridge regression model to predict voxel-wise activations in the\namygdala in response to natural scene images. We hypothesized that if we could predict the\nactivation of voxels in the amygdala, which governs the fight-or-flight response, we could use\nthe corresponding images to modulate voxel-wise activation, potentially alleviating symptoms\nof anxiety and depression. However, this project was halted due to high noise in amygdala\nactivations, compounded by variability among subjects and scanners. Despite this setback,\nthe enthralling potential to encode voxel-wise activity to predict and influence neurological\noutcomes deepened my fascination with modeling brain connectivity.\nRecognizing the limitations of focusing on a single brain region, I shifted to a whole-brain\nconnectivity approach to explore neurological vulnerability to heavy alcohol use in adolescents.\nFascinated by the intricate interplay between the functional and structural connections within\nthe connectome, which can be represented by connectivity matrices, I investigated whether\ncombining these measures could predict the onset of problematic drinking. Our work identified\nboth regional and network-level influences on future problematic drinking, offering potential\ntargets for early clinical intervention. This research earned a P&G Technical Excellence\nAward, and I am currently preparing a first-author paper.\nLeading this project independently was formative for me as a researcher. I learned that\nselecting the most suitable model requires careful evaluation of the research problem rather\nthan architectural complexity. Starting with an interpretable logistic regression model, I\n2",

Additionally, I strengthened\nmy ability to seek timely feedback and distill complex challenges into clear, actionable steps,\nincluding addressing covariance between brain regions and reducing parameter space with\nupper-triangular connectome matrices.\nMoreover, my involvement in a multidisciplinary lab, collaborating with neuroscience\nand ECE researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine and Cornell Tech, enhanced my ability\nto integrate insights from diverse fields. I gained valuable technical expertise from my\nengineering peers, while my neuroscience colleagues provided crucial context for applying\nthese tools within the complexities of the brain, granting me a holistic perspective that I am\neager to bring to future research endeavors.\nFuture Goals and Why Columbia\nBuilding upon my research, I am eager to deepen my focus on the synergistic interplay\nbetween AI and neuroscience. I aim to expand my current work by developing models that\nmap brain regions and structures to specific behaviors and neurological conditions. This\nwill ultimately enhance diagnostic and therapeutic tools, while also identifying neuroimaging\nbiomarkers to halt or delay disease progression. Simultaneously, I am curious about how\nthis deeper understanding of the brain can inspire algorithms that mimic its outstanding\nadaptability.\nColumbia’s commitment to interdisciplinary research, exemplified by close collaborations\nacross the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Zuckerman Mind Brain\nBehavior Institute, provides the ideal environment to pursue my synergistic interests. I\nam particularly drawn to Professor Elham Azizi’s work on modulating cancer progression\nthrough computational tools, which aligns with my desire to bridge neuroscience and AI.\nProfessor Kaveri Thakoor’s work on automating biomedical image analysis to treat eye\ndiseases also resonates with my interest in creating interpretable deep learning models for\nclinical applications. Additionally, I would be excited to work with Professor Shalmali Joshil\n3",
