My research interest focuses on the intersection of robot learning and plan-\nning, autonomous navigation, and natural language processing (NLP). While contemporary\ntaskandmotionplanning(TAMP)techniqueshavemaderemarkableprogressinrecentyears,\nthere are still prevalent challenges in reliably adapting to complex environments. This diffi-\nculty restricts many modern learning methods to simulation or immutable real-world tasks.\nVitaltoovercomingsuchdeficienciesistheabilitytoapplycausalreasoningduringthelearn-\ning process, something that human-intelligence and language naturally facilitate. Motivated\nby these challenges, my research aims to develop intelligent generalist robots capable of inte-\ngratingintosocietybyincorporatingNLPintotheirlearningandplanningprocesses.\nResearch in Natural Language Processing. My first research experience was during an\nNSF-fundedResearchExperienceforUndergraduates(REU)atOldDominionUniversity(ODU).\nWithlimitedresearchopportunitiesavailableatmycommunitycollege,Iwasecstatictobegin\nresearchingbeforetakingmyfirstuniversity-levelcomputersciencecourse. WhileIacknowl-\nedged that acquiring relevant research experience in my position would be more challenging\nthan in a traditional university setting, I was able to overcome this barrier through actively\nseeking outside opportunities. The objective of this project was to evaluate the capabilities of\nlarge language models (LLMs) on the task of scientific claim verification (SCV). Prompted by\nthe recent increase of disinformation in scientific news, we proposed a robust and generaliz-\nablesolutiontoautomatedSCV.OurexperimentsexplorediftheLLMcouldapplyhuman-like\nreasoning to discern real news claims from fake claims. To answer this question, I built and\ntestedadatasetconsistingof200pairsofresearchpapersandscientificnewsclaimsacross10\nsubjectdomains. TheLLMwassuppliedwitharesearchpaperrelevanttotheclaimandasked\nto determine if the research supported or contradicted the news.

Theopportunitytoconduct\nresearch under the winner of the Lemelson-MIT \"Drive it!\" award, Dr. Joshua Siegel, and the\nfounder of Robofest, Dr. Chan-Jin Chung, was another influential experience that further re-\ninforcedmymotivationtopursueaPh.D.Tosupplementrecentadvancesmadetoconnected\nand autonomous vehicles, our goal was to develop a Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) roadside\nunit (RSU) for autonomous intersection control.

Mymajorcontributionwas\ndeveloping the adaptive speed algorithm: the crucial logic for planning the agent’s approach\nto the intersection. At each light change, the RSU sent data to the vehicle controller which\nadjusted the vehicle’s speeds. In effect, this synchronized each agent’s approach to the inter-\nsectionwiththegreenlighttimings. IimplementedGPSwaypointsandtheCosine-Haversine\nformulatoplanthevehicle’smotiontotheintersection.

This research led to a first-author conference\nsubmission to ICRA 2025, currently under review. A core requirement for safe and effective au-\ntonomous systems is reliable navigation during task performance. Acknowledging this, we\nPage1of2",

I am excited to attend Columbia University due to its faculty research\nthat is highly aligned with my research direction. I would be particularly excited to work\nwith Professors Matei Ciocarlie, Hod Lipson, and Carl Vondrick. At CU, I hope to combine\nmyuniqueexperiencesinresearchinghuman-likeintelligenceandmotionplanningtoanswer\nthe following: (I) Can LLM code generation enable runtime task planning when specifying\na full behavior policy is not practical? (II) How can SLAM techniques be used to augment\nsocially-aware navigation planning in assistive robots? (III) Can the proposed generalized\ntask-planning model interface with a socially aware motion-planning model to create a safe\nand generalizable framework for assistive robots? Instrumental activities of daily living such\nas shopping, fetching medications or food, and housekeeping for individuals with limited\nmobilityarehigh-impactapplicationsthatcouldbenefitimmenselyfromthiswork.\nProfessor Ciocarlie has done inspiring work in the learning domain by introducing rein-\nforcement learning of policies for complex skills, such as precision object grasping. Professor\nVondrick’s work on discovering biases in large vision-language models is an area of focus\nsimilar to my research on human-like reasoning for SCV and is another project that I could\nbring my unique experiences to. Similarly, I would be excited to contribute to his work on\ninterpretablevisualrepresentations,asitcombinesLLMswithcomputervision,bothareasof\nresearch that I have experience in. Professor Lipson’s recent work on aligning AI-driven dis-\ncovery with human intuition is very closely aligned with my interest in human-like planning\nwithLLMsandattemptstounderstandstatevariableswithoutfullsystemknowledge.
