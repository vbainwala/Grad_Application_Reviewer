I am captivated by how the brain\u2019s remarkable adaptability and efficiency inspire new systems and algorithms, and how those developments, in turn, deepen our understanding of the brain. My research thus far aims to strengthen this interplay by building more accurate models of brain-behavior relationships, holistically integrating both the brain\u2019s functional and structural connections. At Columbia, I am eager to leverage computational advancements to further this exciting feedback loop of discovery: using AI to better understand the brain and subsequently drawing inspiration from the brain to develop more efficient AI algorithms. Through this iterative approach, I aim to enhance medical applications by refining disease prognosis, identifying reliable biomarkers, improving diagnostic accuracy, and supporting personalized treatment strategies. Finding My Research Passions My initial desire to pursue research was fueled by my curiosity to understand how humans can leverage AI to enhance interactions with the environment. This passion led me to study wearable sensing systems with Professor Cheng Zhang in Information Science at Cornell University, where I focused on using AI to continuously estimate 3D hand poses through active acoustic sensing\u2014the reflection and diffraction of inaudible sound waves. To achieve this, we developed EchoWrist1, a wristband that emits inaudible sound waves towards the hand and captures the resulting echoes to identify various hand poses. I spearheaded user studies to optimize microphone and speaker placement and helped train a custom CNN model to deduce hand poses from 20 finger joints. Our work, published in CHI \u201924, honed my ability to conduct independent, in-depth analysis within a research domain. 1Chi-Jung Lee et al., \u201dEchoWrist: Continuous Hand Pose Tracking and Hand-Object Interaction Recogni- tionUsingLow-PowerActiveAcousticSensingOnaWristband,\u201dCHI \u201924: Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: https://doi.org/10.1145/3613904.3642910 James Kim Columbia University biojameskim2002@gmail.com By reviewing pertinent literature, I identified our project\u2019s limitations, distinguished existing wristband form factors from novel approaches, and uncovered potential applications. While I was fascinated with EchoWrist\u2019s potential for monitoring psychiatric disorders like Tourette Syndrome, I sought a more fundamental approach to treating and modulating neurologicalconditionsbeforetheironset,ratherthanfocusingsolelyonobservablephenotypes. This curiosity led me to collaborate with Professors Amy Kuceyeski and Mert Sabuncu in the Department of Radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine and ECE at Cornell Tech, where I became captivated with modeling the brain\u2019s functional and structural connections. In my first project, I built a ridge regression model to predict voxel-wise activations in the amygdala in response to natural scene images. We hypothesized that if we could predict the activation of voxels in the amygdala, which governs the fight-or-flight response, we could use the corresponding images to modulate voxel-wise activation, potentially alleviating symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, this project was halted due to high noise in amygdala activations, compounded by variability among subjects and scanners. Despite this setback, the enthralling potential to encode voxel-wise activity to predict and influence neurological outcomes deepened my fascination with modeling brain connectivity. Recognizing the limitations of focusing on a single brain region, I shifted to a whole-brain connectivity approach to explore neurological vulnerability to heavy alcohol use in adolescents. Fascinated by the intricate interplay between the functional and structural connections within the connectome, which can be represented by connectivity matrices, I investigated whether combining these measures could predict the onset of problematic drinking. Our work identified both regional and network-level influences on future problematic drinking, offering potential targets for early clinical intervention. This research earned a P&G Technical Excellence Award, and I am currently preparing a first-author paper. Leading this project independently was formative for me as a researcher. I learned that selecting the most suitable model requires careful evaluation of the research problem rather than architectural complexity. Starting with an interpretable logistic regression model, I James Kim Columbia University biojameskim2002@gmail.com iteratively explored more complex architectures like CNNs and GNNs to effectively encode spatial locality information of brain regions in the connectome. Additionally, I strengthened my ability to seek timely feedback and distill complex challenges into clear, actionable steps, including addressing covariance between brain regions and reducing parameter space with upper-triangular connectome matrices. Moreover, my involvement in a multidisciplinary lab, collaborating with neuroscience and ECE researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine and Cornell Tech, enhanced my ability to integrate insights from diverse fields. I gained valuable technical expertise from my engineering peers, while my neuroscience colleagues provided crucial context for applying these tools within the complexities of the brain, granting me a holistic perspective that I am eager to bring to future research endeavors. Future Goals and Why Columbia Building upon my research, I am eager to deepen my focus on the synergistic interplay between AI and neuroscience. I aim to expand my current work by developing models that map brain regions and structures to specific behaviors and neurological conditions. This will ultimately enhance diagnostic and therapeutic tools, while also identifying neuroimaging biomarkers to halt or delay disease progression. Simultaneously, I am curious about how this deeper understanding of the brain can inspire algorithms that mimic its outstanding adaptability. Columbia\u2019s commitment to interdisciplinary research, exemplified by close collaborations across the Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute, provides the ideal environment to pursue my synergistic interests. I am particularly drawn to Professor Elham Azizi\u2019s work on modulating cancer progression through computational tools, which aligns with my desire to bridge neuroscience and AI. Professor Kaveri Thakoor\u2019s work on automating biomedical image analysis to treat eye diseases also resonates with my interest in creating interpretable deep learning models for clinical applications. Additionally, I would be excited to work with Professor Shalmali Joshil James Kim Columbia University biojameskim2002@gmail.com to advance the safe and equitable application of ML in personalized healthcare settings. My undergraduate experiences have fostered a deep passion for tackling new challenges, collaborating with talented peers, and mentoring fellow students. Columbia\u2019s rigorous yet supportive environment offers the platform to pursue these passions at the highest level. As I strive to become a well-rounded researcher who deepens our understanding of AI and the brain to improve lives both within and beyond clinical settings, I would love to join a community that champions innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration at the forefront of AI and neuroscience.",
