    "SOP": "Samantha O\u2019Connell My interest in this program leads to my post-graduation and career goals. I want to further my education in computer science and learn more about STEM in order to become a successful software developer or related career. I want to develop my skills, learn from my peers and professors, and further my knowledge to become the CEO of my own company someday. I know the best way to start my journey is through education. I was lucky to enter colleges and universities that offered me unique opportunities. Such as New York University, which allowed me to develop soft and career-focused skills. In addition to learning about information technology, cybersecurity, project management, and networking. Columbia University could provide me with research, internship, and job opportunities that I may otherwise not be able to have. But more importantly, a valuable education. I always wanted to be a scientist. The older I became, the more insight I slowly gained into a career I wanted. I started off with interactive earth science as a kid and made my way to game design in high school. I changed my major in the Borough of Manhattan Community College due to an obstacle I could not avoid. However, this only made my passion for STEM and art stronger. More recently, I am finishing my degree at New York University School of Professional Studies. I took advantage of any and all resources I could find for myself\u2013sending anything I could not use to other students who needed it. I believe my journey has led me to Columbia University. I am hopeful that I can get the Master\u2019s/Ph.D. track and develop my skills to continue to help myself, as well as others. I did not see the option on the application but spoke with a recruiter who said the track was possible for me. In addition to a fee waiver for attending the session. Overall, I am excited about this opportunity--I can learn more STEM, help more people, and continue my academic journey. I am open to other career paths and opportunities. I am someone who enjoys a multitude of genres and making friends or connections. I want to start my career journey within a technical industry, build my way to becoming a professor, and end my career as the CEO of a company that made a positive difference in society. I hope to and believe I will gain further knowledge in software development, back-end development, and STEM. I would say that despite my disabilities--I always try my best in all I do. I take risks like this personal statement/ by applying to Columbia. I always try to improve the world around me. Samantha O\u2019Connell Though, I worry about my ability to pay for my tuition as a low-income student. If given the opportunity, I would love to work or participate in any internship, fellowship, or program that could cover my tuition. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration.",
