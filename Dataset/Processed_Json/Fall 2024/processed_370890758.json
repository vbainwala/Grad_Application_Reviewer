When I was in high school my favorite subjects were English and science, I had graduated from high school with a high GPA in my science and English courses. When I was a child, my dream was to come to United States of America and continue my education. Finally, the dream became a reality, I went to The College of Staten Island, a very peaceful place, and nice facilities. I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 2022. Nonetheless, I have started taking graduate courses in electrical engineering and I will graduate this fall semester 2022. Moreover, I have taken all the available courses at the college of Staten Island, the College of Staten has a lot of graduate courses in electrical engineering. I have decided to continue my education further by applying to your PhD program in electrical engineering, (Energy and power) and I have done multiple research projects. On smart grid and power consumption. And here I am. Thank you for your prerogative\u2019s time.",
