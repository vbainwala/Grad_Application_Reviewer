My initial interestinmachinelearning developedwhenItook DataSciencePrinciples and DataScienceLabatthe Universityof Texas atAustin. Mydesireto workon machine learningresearch developed whenIwas acceptedtoa computationalbiologyResearch Experiencefor Undergraduates (REU) atthe Universityof Tennesseeat Chattanooga.I worked under Dr.YuLiangand Dr.Dalei Wu onaproject developingagraph neuralnetwork tobetter predictCOVID-19 spread. Inthis experience,Ilearned theimportanceof goingthrough literature andtesting different neuralnetworkstogenerate betterresults. I realizedIenjoyed the multidisciplinary interface between machinelearningand biology. My fascinationwith thebrainfirst developedwhenI tookcoursesin neuroengineering and brain-computer interactions withDr.Jose Millan.I enjoyedlearning aboutdifferent neurotechnologiesthat improve thelivesof peoplewith disabilities.I decidedtocontinue exploring thefieldbyconductingaresearch projectwithDr.Millan ondecodingand classifying neural signalsfrom thehippocampus withthegoal ofrestoringmemory.I gained valuable experienceusingMATLAB toimplement filtersandmachinelearning algorithms onneuraldata. This alongwithmy appreciation for multidisciplinaryresearchled metopursueopportunities combiningmachine learning andneuroscienceresearch. ChrisZhuang A coursein digital imageprocessingestablishedmy specificinterestinneuroimaging. I was especiallyinterestedin denoisingandsuperresolution, andwanted toexplorethe applicationstowardsmedical images.Thefollowing semester, Iworked withDr. BoZhaoon inverseimagingproblemsusing magneticresonance imaging(MRI)data collected fromthe brain.I learnedto implementdifferentmachine learningmodelsfor imageprocessing like the U-Netand thedeepimage prior.Thisexperiencetaught methe importanceofunderstanding the mathematical intuitionbehind specificimageproblemslike MRInoise beforeapproaching it with machinelearning. I further explored image processing thispast summer intheWellman-HST Summer Institutefor Biomedical OpticsREUat MassachusettsGeneral Hospital(MGH).I internedunder Dr.Benjamin Vakoctoimplementa nervedetectionalgorithm usingdata collected from polarization sensitiveopticalcoherence tomography,anexciting imagingtechniquethat uses polarized lightto detectintensity,phase retardation, andoptic axisorientation.I wasable to implement theMaskR-CNN,aninstance segmentationmodel, andgothrough theentire process of creating adataset.In thisexperience,I learnedhow toimplement computer visionalgorithms, utilizedockerto setupa local hostfor annotations, andconnectresults tophysiological properties alongwithpropertiesof theimagingmodality.Towards the endofthe summer,Ihad theopportunity toprepare andpresent aresearchposteronmy workwhichI sharedwithmy peers andtheresearch community atMGH. Thisexperienceconfirmedmypassionfor research and myinterestin neuroimaging withafocusonimageprocessing andmachinelearning. Columbiaoffers the opportunitytoexplore machinelearningand imageprocessing though theVisionand Roboticstrack. Iplan todivedeep intomachine learningandcomputer vision, andthenbranchout intothe neuroimaging realm.I wanttodevelop theintuition and ChrisZhuang understanding of themachinelearning toolsthat I amusing beforeapplying them for neuroimaging clinicalapplications likeMRI superresolutionor nervedetection.I amexcited to take coursesinmathematicsfor machinelearning andsignalrecognition, deeplearning for computervision, andapplied machinelearning.I amalso excitedbyall the facultyinthe Vision and Roboticstrack,and I would hopetobe ableto workwithDr.Shih-FuChang. Dr.Chang\u2019s work onfew-shotobjectdetectionexcites meas Ibelieve therecouldbe manyapplicationsfor neuroimaging wherecompleteimagescan bescarce. After graduation,Iplan topursueacareerin academia.My interestinteachingdeveloped whenI was ateaching assistantfor Probability andMultivariable Calculus. Myrole for both involved holding officehours andgradinghomework. Inorderto helpthe studentssucceed,I made suretoreviewthematerial, fillinknowledge gaps,and regularlyconsulttheprofessor. Collaboratingwith thegraduate teachingassistantsfor theseclasses helped mesee theirpassion for teaching andability toeasilydisseminate engineeringknowledge. Iam lookingforward to theopportunity of beingagraduate teachingassistantatColumbia, asI believeit willboost my ability tothrive inacademia.",
