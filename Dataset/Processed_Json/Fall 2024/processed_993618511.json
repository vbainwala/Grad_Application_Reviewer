    "SOP": "PersonalStatement I have always been the biggest fan of sci-fi. It often gave me an optimistic outlook on the relationship betweentechnologyandsociety.Ever sinceIstarted mycomputer sciencejourneyat the University of Toronto, it seemed to me that the line between fantasy and reality had been getting blurrier day by day enabled by constant breakthroughs of artificial intelligence near me. Inspired by endless opportunities, I took the initiative and grasped ontomyfascination withthis ever-growing fieldfor myprofessional development. During my undergraduate studies, I wasfirst introducedtothe worldof AIina visualcomputing course notorious among students for its challenging mathematical concepts not suited for the faint-hearted. Throughout the course, I studied and implemented numerous algorithms for real-world computer vision applications that I never thought to be possible before, and this led me to explore advanced concepts such as machine learning. I utilized the opportunity to take every AI-related course the CS department had to offer and excel in them. Most of these upper-level courses were cross-listed with thegraduate departmentandgaveme aglimpseof the life of a graduate student long before graduate school. In my senior year,I workedas aresearch student under the supervision of Dr. Anna Goldenberg at Toronto\u2019s Hospital for Sick Children. Initially funded by a grant from the Canadian government, I then continued my position as a research employee after graduation. During my two years at the hospital, I was involved in integrating a machine learning model in the ICU to monitor patient status and predict deterioration, such as cardiac arrest events, in order to alert staff to apply preemptive measures, which canbecritical inmoments oflife anddeath. Ibuilt data streamingpipelinesthat dealtwith both live data and historical data, contributed to the usability design in the ICU, and eventually Huang, Xi delivered the tool to its clinical trial. Furthermore, I employed NLP techniques using Transformer models to de-identify patient information in medical records to provide data for future research. I was fortunate enough to have gained much project experience, witnessing the incredible synergy of combining AI with healthcare. This rather new effort not only minimized the stress on paramedics but also enabled the automatic detection and analysis of patient conditions. While the work demanded the repetition of various experiments and occasionally posed challenges, the sense of fulfillment and pride was truly gratifying, as I saw impactful change inthemedicalindustry. While I worked on my master\u2019s degree in software engineering atCarnegieMellonUniversity,I continued to take ML courses and got involved with more ML research throughout my entire degree. I waspartof an object recognition projectat CMUincollaboration withWalmartwhere I processed image data and trained Visual Transformer models.I amcurrentlyinvolved inanother computer vision research project under Dr. Asim Smailagic exploringaninnovative approachin medical image analysis combining neural network with wavelet transformation that removes unnecessary detailsin theimagepreservingprivacy andreducingcomputation withoutimpacting performance, and we are in progress to publishing our work. Aside from ML work in this project, I was able to revisit the mathematical side of computer vision, which took me back to when I first discovered the wonders of AI algorithms. I utterlyenjoyed myresearchexperiences working with differentaspects ofAI,as theyhave shownmehow much goodAIcanbring toour current societyin aworld of dataand Iam dedicatedtocontinuingmy journeyfurtheringmyself. In addition to research, I have had two years of industry experience working at State Streetas a cloud software engineer. I eagerly seized the opportunity to master a range of software development tools and refine my software-building skills. This experience has prepared me for Huang, Xi my master's studies in software engineering and helped me gain avaluableunderstanding ofthe tech industry. This experience has also equipped me withthebeneficial insightsofcollaborating within a team, both in person and remotely. My industry experience, coupled with pragmatic software engineering training that I have done during my master\u2019s degree, has shown me practical aspectsthatareasbeneficialas theoreticalknowledge inresearchwork. Perhaps with a different concept of self-worth, I am more captivated with chiseling into the unknown, a diversion from the common goal of my peers in my industry-oriented program of \u201cmaking big money\u201d straight out of graduationas asoftware engineer.Withmygrowing interest in using ML to improve life, I deem that the elevation of myself in research is imperative. Iam anxious to work with professors with overlapped interests in ML at Columbia. I have a deep yearning to boost my individual research ability as well as thecapacity toresolvetech problems innovatively. The academic prowess here has been world-renowned and the ML research has been diverse in various areas among whichIwouldlike tolearn morein.Ilook forwardtobeing an active member in the CS program, and to studying and working in a vigorous community. After my PhD studies, I look forward to working as a scientist, extending mystudies intheML field, and contributing to the development of AI in the realworld. Iwant todivedeeply into my own expertise,especiallyinhealthcareand theapplication ofnewAI technologies,and Iam very optimistic about my career paths after completing a PhD as a scientist. I\u2019m confident that Iwill be content ina fieldof prosperousinnovationbridging reality andsci-fi.I know thatit willbe far from a smooth ride, but I await to broaden my skill set and knowledge with pleasure, knowing what I will be trying to do is unique, inspiring more intelligent development in the areas that benefitmankind\u2019s future.
