    "SOP": "StatementofPurpose My introduction to Fluid Mechanics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) happened during my sophomore year when I enrolled in the Fluid Mechanics course. I vividly recall a defining moment when the professor showcased a brief video highlighting his recent research. The video featured a mesmerizing visualization of flow patterns around a circular cylinder. Witnessing the intricate flow dynamics surrounding what appeared to be a simplegeometricshapeleftaprofoundimpressionon me. It was this moment that ignited my interest to delve deeper into the world of CFD. I consider myself fortunatetohavestudiedatoneofIndia'spremierinstitutions,withanacceptancerateofless than 2%. This esteemed academic environment provided me with unparalleled opportunities to collaborate with highly knowledgeable and experienced professors. I wholeheartedly embraced these opportunities to expand my horizons and deepen my understanding of fluid dynamics and computationalsimulations. In the subsequent summer vacation, I worked as an intern at DHIO Research and Engineering, India, where I was introduced to the different aspects of the CFD simulation: geometry creation, meshing, setting up the solver, applying boundary conditions, and interpreting the results. I learned about meshing and the importance of using a good mesh. Furthermore, I learned how to perform mesh independence study and validation study, an essential precursor to any research work. Most notably, I learned how tounderstandandinterprettheflowdatageneratedfromthesimulations.The final project of the internship was to simulate a cyclonic separator and predict its separation efficiency using ANSYS Fluent. TheprojectwasundoubtedlyagatewayformeintothefieldofCFD, anddespitehavingsuchasteeplearningcurve,Ilearnedmanythingsduringtheproject. As I found my sophomore year internship on numerical simulations interesting, I took a Numerical Techniques course in my junior year, instructed by Dr. Pritanshu Ranjan. Here I learned about the inner workings of CFD solvers. The course taught me how numerical simulations aredone,starting from the governing equations, converting them to linear systems of equations, applying boundary conditions, and solving them using iterative methods such as Gauss-Seidel, TDMA, and the use of under-relaxing and over-relaxing factors along with other concepts. The first half of the course focused more on Finite Difference Method (FDM) and its limitations while the next half focused on the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation using Finite Volume Method (FVM) and its implementation using staggered gridsanditerativealgorithmssuchasSIMPLE,PISO,andPIMPLE. As a part of the curriculum, I implemented some of these techniques in MATLAB codes to model well-knownproblems,suchasLidDrivenCavityandPoiseuilleFlow. Having developed abetterunderstandingoffluidmechanics,Iwishedtoexploreitsuseinreal-world problems. Prof. Kiran Ramesh at the University of Glasgow guided me in my junior year summer internship project to study the flow physicsofanairfoil-basedturbinetoextractenergyfromtides.In this project, I used a Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) based in-house solver written in Julia to simulate the performance of the turbine. The project was very insightful as I learned about the state-of-the-art research in tidal energy extraction. I also learned about DVM, a method where individual vortex elements are used for simulation in contrast to a full-fledged simulationcarriedout in CFD. The project also introduced me to aeroelastic modeling and fluid-structure interaction (FSI) andsubsequently,manyofmyresearchprojectsexploredthisarea. In my junior year, I took a design-oriented project course offered by our university, under the guidance of Dr. Vaibhav Joshi. Dr. Joshi hadexperienceinFSImodeling,andIworkedunderhimto understand FSI modeling using Finite Element Method (FEM). I used FEM to solve the Navier-Stokes equation, the structural equation, and the mesh movement equation. The governing equations were solved in the moving mesh Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) framework. I developed the MATLAB code for 2D two-way coupled problems and used it to study anaeroelastic airfoil. I also worked under the guidance of Prof. Pritanshu Ranjan, to study passive flow control techniques for drag reduction using OpenFOAM. I was inspired to study this topic after learning about the use of dimples in golfballs.Throughthisproject,Idiscoveredthatthroughoptimalplacing of dimples on the exterior of geometry, flow separations can be prevented, which significantly reduces the drag. In the subsequent semester, I also had the opportunity to work under the supervision of Prof. Sridhar Ravi, at the UniversityofNewSouthWales,Australiatoexploretheuse of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), whichisadimensionalityreductiontechnique.Ideveloped codeinJuliatoperformDMDontheflowdataextractedfromthein-houseCFDsolver. My collaboration with Dr. Joshi also served as my introduction to the realm of biomimetics. One aspect that particularly piqued my interest and kindled my desire for further exploration was the study of fluid mechanics in collective motion among variousspecies,includingthecoordinatedflight of bird flocks and the synchronized swimming of fish schools. What intrigued me about these phenomena was their evolutionary development over millions of years, resulting in highly efficient and specialized modes of movement. Hence in my undergraduate thesis at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden, I explored the fluid dynamics of triple synchronous flapping foils under the guidance of Dr. Yao. This was a challenging topic for me because I soon realized that the mesh movements I had used earlier were notfeasibleduetoexcessivemeshdeformation.Toremedythis problem, I used the Overset (Chimera) mesh technique, where the mesh attached to the structure moves independently of the background mesh, and the flow variables are interpolated between different meshes. UsingOversetmeshesandOpenFOAMIstudiedtheproblem,varyingthespacing between the airfoils. I identified the primary thrust generation mechanism, which was due to the formation of a Leading Edge Vortex (LEV) which generated favorable pressure gradients. For multi-foil systems, I also studied the vortexinteractionsbetweentheupstreamanddownstreamfoils andclassifiedthemaccordingtotheefficiencyandthrusttheygenerated. At Columbia University, I always wanted to combine myknowledgeoffluidmechanicswithrobotics, particularly with its applications in underwater robotics. Therefore, as a first step, I developed a bipedal walking robot, completely from scratch, starting with a concept sketch, initial and detailed CAD design, electronics, and even programming. I uploaded the journey video to YouTube as well (link). Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of robotics, I also had the opportunity to learn more about MachineLearning,ReinforcementLearning,andGPUcomputing,whichIcontinuedtoexplore inthefuture. My interest in GPU computing and itsapplicationstoCFDledmetopursuesummerresearchunder the guidance of Dr. Shaina Kelly at Columbia University where I developed JLBM.jl, a high-performance, GPU-accelerated software to model flows written in the Julia programming language. The software utilizes the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), which is a method of Computational Fluid Dynamics where the Boltzmann equation is solved instead of Navier Stokes equation. The software harnessed the massive parallelization capabilities of the GPU through the CUDA library and achieved 90% memory utilization. I am also currently working on publishing my work with Dr. Kelly. In the final semester of my Master\u2019s program, I will continue toworkonJLBM.jl andapplyittomodelporousmediaflows.
