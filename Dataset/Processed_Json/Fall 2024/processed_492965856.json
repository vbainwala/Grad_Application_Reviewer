However, despiteAlphaFoldundoubtedlybeingamilestoneachievement,thestructuresitpredictsstilllackcriticalbi- ologicalcontext: Insteadofexistinginisolation,proteinsofteninteractwithsmallchemicalcompoundsthat areessentialtotheirfunction. Smallchemicalcompoundsarealsothemostcommonlyemployedclassof drug used to modulate protein function. More advanced models for predicting protein-ligand interactions are therefore needed to fully leverage the power of current machine learning methods for drug discovery against novel targets. In addition, the recent success in protein structure prediction has been followed by significant advancements in generative modelling of entirely new protein structures. Models incorpo- rating cutting-edge research from geometric deep learning and natural language processing have already shown promising success for designing proteins with desired features, yet there is still a lot of potential for pushing the frontier. Combining a background in Biochemistry with more than 2.5 years of computational research experience, I believe I am ideally suited to tackle such research questions. As a PhD student in the Columbia Computer Science program, I therefore plan to focus on developing novel machine learning methodsforpredictingmolecularinteractionsanddesigningnewproteinswithtailoredproperties. MyundergraduatestudieshavegivenmeafundamentalunderstandingoftheproblemsIamnowtry- ing to solve with machine learning. After graduating high school as best student in my year with an award fromtheGermanChemicalSociety,IjoinedtheprestigiousBiochemistryprogramatHeidelbergUniversity as one of only 25 selected students, where I learned about the inner workings of proteins and molecular causesofdiseases. InmyfirstresearchprojectinProfessorMaikeBublitz\u2019sgroupattheUniversityofOx- ford, I used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a membrane protein in complex with novel inhibitors. Now,Iamusingsuchexperimentalproteinstructuresastrainingdataformachinelearningmod- els,andmypreviousexperiencewithcrystallographyhasprovenatremendousadvantageforconstructing bespokehigh-qualitydatasets. Working on molecular docking simulations with Professor Rebecca Wade for my bachelor\u2019s thesis at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies (HITS), I experienced firsthand how computational algo- rithms can efficiently generate plausible mechanistic hypotheses. Since then, I have used my master\u2019s studiestospecializeincomputationalbiologywithcourseworksuchasBioinformatics/MolecularDynamics, andFoundationsofmachinelearningandhigh-dimensionaldataanalysis. Aimingtogetanunderstanding of diverse problems in the field, I chose to work on a breadth of research projects, ranging from physics- based protein design in Professor Bruno Correia\u2019s group at E\u00b4cole Polytechnique Fe\u00b4de\u00b4rale de Lausanne 1 PersonalStatement LukasJarosch (EPFL) to analyzing high-dimensional transcriptomics data in Dr. Judith Zaugg\u2019s group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL). Exploring different research fields has taught me how to quickly assimilate new knowledge through self-study, for example by getting up to speed with the programming languageRinjustafewweekswhenstartingatEMBL.Myresearchhasbeenproductive,withpartsofmy bachelor\u2019sthesisintegratedintoajournalsubmissiontoCirculation,andtwoothermanuscriptscurrentlyin writing. I have long been interested in machine learning methods and their ability to easily grasp complex patterns in high-dimensional data. This motivated me to join Roche for a 6-month project on probabilistic modeling of antibody sequences from display datasets. Display campaigns involve the vast screening of antibodylibrariesagainsttargetepitopesovermultipleroundsinordertoenrichstronglybindingsequences. Givenalarge-scaledatasetofmillionsofantibodyvariantsfromsuchacampaign,Iworkedondeveloping modelsforpredictingtheaffinityofexperimentallyunobservedsequencesusingGaussianprocesses(GPs). Studyingtheliteraturesurroundingstochasticprocessesprovedchallengingatfirst, thoughIquicklycame toappreciatetherigorousuncertaintyestimatesprovidedbyBayesianmodels. Comparedtothepreviously usedrandomforests,myGPmodelsimprovedpredictiveperformanceandwereabletomuchbetterquantify their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution sequences. In order to streamline the future application of those models, I wrote the \u201cBayDisplay\u201d Python library for working with Gaussian processes on display datasets, which is now internally used at Roche. Additionally, I presented my findings as a poster at the ProteinEngineeringSummitBoston(PEGSBoston2023). My master\u2019s thesis in the AlQuraishi laboratory at Columbia has allowed me to fully merge my back- ground in computational biochemistry with my interest in cutting-edge machine learning methods. The maingoalofmythesisistoexpandAlphaFoldintoamodelthatisfullycapableofprotein-ligandco-folding, bridgingthepreviouslymentionedgapbetweenproteinstructurepredictionanddrugdiscovery. Leveraging my past experience in working with protein structures and large-scale sequence datasets, I first created a novel high-quality dataset of protein-ligand complexes and also computed new multiple sequence align- ments, required as inputs to AlphaFold, which have become part of a publication accepted at NeurIPS 2023 Datasets and Benchmarks. By adding ligand representations and customized loss functions to the network,Isuccessfullyimplementedthefirstversionoftheco-foldingmodel\u201cOpenBind\u201d. Firstexperiments withOpenBindhaveshownpromisingresultsonsmallertestsets,andthemodeliscurrentlybeingtrained atlargescaleonthefulltrainingdata. InmyPhDIamhopingtocontinueworkingwithProfessorAlQuraishi towardspushingthefrontierofmachinelearningformolecularmodeling. Delving deep into AlphaFold\u2019s source code made me appreciate how inter-disciplinary approaches 2 PersonalStatement LukasJarosch are key for tackling grand challenges such as the protein structure prediction problem. AlphaFold\u2019s archi- tecture borrows from multiple different fields, combining graph transformers, SE(3)-equivariant attention, and masked language modeling, and recent protein design models have taken a similarly integrated ap- proach. Ithereforelookforwardtofurtherstrengtheningmyunderstandingofspecializedresearchareasin machine learning and am excited about potential learning and collaboration opportunities with Columbia\u2019s stronganddiverseComputerSciencefaculty. IamintriguedbyProfessorKnowles\u2019workonBayesianmod- els for genomics, and I believe that probabilistic modeling also holds great potential for protein design. In addition,therecentsuccessofproteinlanguagemodelspiquedmyinterestinnaturallanguageprocessing, andIhavebeenparticularlyimpressedbytheresearchofProfessorMcKeownandProfessorCollins. In conclusion, my previous academic experience has uniquely prepared me for pursuing graduate researchindevelopingmodelsformolecularmodelingandproteindesign.
